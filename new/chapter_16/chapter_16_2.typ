== Religious Poetry and Church Hymns
<religious-poetry-and-church-hymns>
A new sphere was opened to Luther’s successful endeavors in the field of
hymnology. In the days of his youth he had become familiar with the
hymns of the Catholic Church and learned to appreciate the value of
congregational singing. He realized that poetry and songs within and
without the church are apt means for conveying religious thoughts to the
hearts of the people. Quite naturally he made use of this means in the
furtherance of his gospel. By his successful poetical compositions he
created a preéminent and efficacious position for the religious hymn
within the Protestant cult. It supplemented the sermon and the defective
liturgy within the church and aroused the minds of the faithful with a
religious and also a militant fervor outside the church walls.

The thirty-fifth volume of the Weimar edition of Luther’s works contains
all the hymns composed by him, as collected by Lucke.#footnote[Cf. also
Erl. ed., Vol. LVI, pp. 291 sqq.]

The series commences with "Ein neues Lied wir heben an" (composed in
1523) and, "Nu freut euch, liebe Christen gemein." In the following year
Luther was most prolific in the production of church hymns. His
"Enchiridion geistlicher Gesänge," published in that year, consisted of
twenty-five hymns, of which fifteen were his own work. Somewhat later in
the same year, Luther and John Walther, a cantor stationed at the court
of Torgau, published a "Geistliches Gesangbüchlein" in Wittenberg. This
hymn-book, as revised in 1529, contained several new hymns, notably the
celebrated "Ein’ feste Burg ist unser Gott" (A mighty fortress is our
God)#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Lutherstudien];, n. 2: "Luthers Trutzlied."
Cf. Lucke, Weimar ed., Vol. LIII.] and also, "Verleih uns Frieden
gnädiglich" and "Herr Gott, dich leben wir." Other hymns of Luther
originated in the period from 1535 to 1546. The battle-hymn, "Erhalt
uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort, Und steur des Papsts und Türken Mord"
(Preserve us, O Lord, in Thy Word, and check the atrocities of Pope and
Turk), was written in 1537.

Luther did not set any of his hymns to music. The melodies were partly
supplied by Walther and many of them are adaptations of earlier melodies
or chorals familiar to the people from Catholic days. The singing of
anthems or secular songs (chorals) by the younger members of Luther’s
household was a favorite means of recreation after meals. Luther gives
expression to his delight thereat in a poem, "To Lady Music," which
prefaced an edition of one of the abovementioned hymnals. The conclusion
of the poem ardently eulogizes the nightingale because of her praise of
God: "She sings and flits in praise of Him, And naught her ardent soul
can dim; Thus, too, my lyre would sound His praise, And thank Him
through the endless days." In another preface Luther develops an
excellent discourse on the educational value of spiritual hymns. In his
opinion they should assist the young "in getting rid of amorous and
carnal songs." All should be convinced that "not all the arts are
overthrown by the gospel, …but I would like to see all the arts,
especially music, serve Him who has bestowed and created them."

Ratzeberger, the physician, tells of another motive of Luther’s
predilection for the art of music. Luther, he says, "discovered that he
was relieved of great depression by music during his temptations and
melancholy spells."#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. II, p. 171.]
In matter of fact, the soothing strains of the church hymns often helped
to assuage the storms that agitated his soul. In a letter to the
composer Senfl, who was in the service of Duke William of Bavaria, and
whose motets he esteemed very highly, he acknowledged that music had
often "refreshed his spirit and relieved him of great
troubles."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];] He requested Senfl to set to music
the text of the Psalm, "In peace I will sleep and rest" (Ps. 4:8); for
this verse afforded him consolation for his approaching death. He was as
weary of the world as it was of him. The letter to Senfl incidentally
embodied an attempt on Luther’s part to regain the favor of the Bavarian
court. Luther, who was desirous of obtaining a foothold in Bavaria,
evidently attached great importance to the friendship and activity of
this highly esteemed composer.
