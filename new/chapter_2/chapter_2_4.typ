== In Wittenberg
<in-wittenberg>
The Augustinians of Wittenberg did not participate in the attack upon
Staupitz in connection with the Observantine controversy. The party of
the vicar was in control there. What attitude did Luther assume towards
him? When he re-entered Germany, his views about this internal question
of discipline were different from those which impelled him to visit
Italy. He became an opponent of the so-called Observantines and espoused
the party of Staupitz. What caused this striking change has never been
fully cleared up. Perhaps the opposition which he encountered at Rome
influenced him. Possibly his transfer from Erfurt to Wittenberg had
something to do with his altered attitude. It is also possible that
Staupitz himself influenced him decisively. Cochlaeus, his subsequent
opponent, who at that time was in touch with the brethren of the Order
and had learned from them some things about Luther, drastically
expresses the change in his conduct thus: "He has apostatized to his
friend Staupitz." For the rest, his change of attitude need not cause
too much surprise in view of the sanguine temperament of the young monk.
It is also permitted to inquire whether the consolidation contemplated
by Staupitz, did not possess some merit. A uniform government of all the
Augustinian monasteries in Germany under an energetic general and active
provincials, according to the general rule of the order, was in itself a
rather desirable thing.

The internal conflict was settled in May of the following year at a
chapter of the Augustinian congregations held in Cologne. The settlement
was effected as a result of the conciliatory policy of Staupitz, who had
previously brought about a certain union of the seven convents at Jena,
in July, 1511. The proposed consolidation of these congregations with
the Saxon province, #emph[i.e.];, with the non-reformed German
Augustinians, was to be abandoned–a proposition with which the general
now agreed. The Cologne chapter was held without the participation of
the "Province of Saxony." This fact alone would indicate a certain
retreat on the part of Staupitz, even if it was but a temporary one. In
the meantime the opposition within the congregation, once having
manifested itself, continued to smoulder. There were friends of the
Observance, and, as it appears, some enthusiasts, who exhibited a strict
compliance with the statutes. On the other hand there were enemies of
the Observance, who complained of unkindnesses and calumnies on the part
of their opponents. In the congested atmosphere of the monasteries the
conflict grew more and more acute.

At Wittenberg, Luther soon became the passionate spokesman of the
opponents of the Observantines, who were by far the more numerous party.
He had participated in the chapter at Cologne (1512), as his works
testify. On the return journey from Cologne, he visited the valley of
Ehrenbreitstein near Koblenz, where a monastery of his Order was
situated at Mühltal.#footnote[H. Grisar, #emph["Luther zu Koln und
Koblenz,"] in the jubilee number of the #emph[Koblenzer Volkszeitung];,
February, 1922.] Paltz, a celebrated Augustinian and a native of Erfurt,
had retired to this monastery some time previously, having become
dissatisfied with his position as theological teacher at the "studium
generale" of his Order at Erfurt. It is possible that Luther, while at
Cologne, had been proposed for the doctorate in theology at Wittenberg.
According to his later story he raised strenuous objections to the
doctorate when Staupitz subsequently discussed this matter with him in
more definite terms at Wittenberg. His objections were based principally
on the state of his health. In spite of this, however, the superiors
would not alter their decision.

In Wittenberg various tasks diverted him from the preparation for the
doctorate. Thus he was obliged to preach in the smaller monastery
church. He was also made subprior in the monastery. On October 4th, he
obtained the academic title of licentiate in theology. A few days later,
on October 9th, we find him at Leipsic, where he writes out a receipt
for fifty guldens, which the Saxon Elector, Frederick, had assigned to
him out of the local exchequer to pay the expenses of his pending
promotion.#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, I, p. 9.] Staupitz declared to
the Elector that the office of Biblical lecturer, which he himself had
occupied at Wittenberg, was henceforth to be entrusted permanently to
Luther.#footnote[Scheel, II, pp. 311 and 431.] According to the terms of
their endowment these lectures were assigned to the Augustinian
monastery. After passing the required examination, Luther was promoted
to the doctorate, on October 19, 1512, in the castle-church at
Wittenberg. The ceremony was held under the direction of the university
professor Andrew Bodenstein of Karlstadt, with whom Luther in after
years lived in strained relations on account of the controversies which
arose over the new doctrines.
