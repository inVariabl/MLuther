== The "Proviso of the Gospel"
<the-proviso-of-the-gospel>
Luther learned with satisfaction that the Augsburg Confession had been
read in the presence of the estates of the Empire. But he did not share
Melanchthon’s expectation that it would lead to some sort of reunion.
His opinion was that rejection was the only thing to be expected from
the "obduracy" of his enemies. He would "not allow himself to be
discouraged, no matter what the course of events" at Augsburg might be,
he declared to Melanchthon.#footnote[On June 29; #emph[Briefwechsel];,
VIII, p. 43.]

In addition to the latter, Jonas, Agricola, Spalatin, Brenz, and others
were active in promoting Luther’s cause. It was to them and to
Melanchthon that he wrote: "If we fall, Christ, the Ruler of the world,
falls with us."#footnote[On June 30; #emph[ibid.];, p. 51.] The Emperor,
though well-intentioned, is unable to prevail against so many devils.
Should he, however, "take a stand against the plain Scriptures or the
Word of God," his decision cannot bind us.#footnote[Cf. Köstlin-Kawerau,
#emph[M. Luther];, Vol. II, pp. 216 sq., 225.] There can be no question
of restoring the property of the Church. It would be an advantage for
his partisans to demand a council, since the demand could not be
satisfied.

At the beginning of the negotiations proposed by Melanchthon, which at
first concerned external matters only, Luther declared himself in favor
of declining all concessions contrary to the Gospel, and demanded
courage and perseverance on the part of his representatives. He would
prefer–thus he wrote on July 15–that they should depart for home. "Ever
and anon homeward, always homeward," is his watch-word.#footnote[Letter
to Jonas, etc.; #emph[Briefwechsel];, VI, p. 113.] His letters to the
Elector John of Saxony also demonstrate his negative attitude.

Under date of August 26, he writes a curious letter to Melanchthon. He
encourages his pusillanimous friend, whom he always treated with great
indulgence, in his ambiguous proposals: "I am certain that you will be
unable to commit aught, except at the utmost a personal offense against
me, so that we shall be charged with perfidy and vacillation. But what
will the consequence be? Matters may easily be remedied by the
steadfastness and the truth of our cause. True, I do not wish that it
should so happen; but speak in such wise that, if it should happen,
despondency do not ensue. For, once we shall have attained peace and
escaped violence, we shall easily make amends for our tricks (lies) and
failings, because God’s mercy rules over us. 'Do manfully, and let your
heart take courage, all ye who wait for the Lord' (Psalm 27:14)." Later
editions have omitted the word “lies (#emph[mendacia];) which appeared
in brackets between "tricks" and "failings." The textual tradition,
however, renders it probable that the deleted word appeared in the
original, which is lost. But even if it had not appeared there, Luther’s
mind is sufficiently expressed by the words "tricks" and "failings"
(#emph[doli et lapsus];).#footnote[On August 28; Briefwechsel, VIII, p.
235. For more details on this letter, see my article on the same in the
#emph[Stimmen aus Maria-Laach];, 1913, No. 3, pp. 286 sqq.]

His strictures grow more severe in course of the following month,
especially when, on September 20, he receives reports from the Nuremberg
representatives at the Augsburg diet, bitterly complaining of
Melanchthon’s obsequiousness. "I am actually bursting with anger and
indignation," he wrote to Jonas on this occasion. "I beseech to cut the
matter short and come back home." "They have our Confession and the
gospel …If war is to come, then let it come. We have done and prayed
enough. The Lord has given them over to us as a holocaust 'to reward
them according to their works' \[2 Tim. 4:14\]; us, His people, He will
save from the fiery furnace of Babylon …What I have written for you is
meant for all."#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. II, p. 391.]

Writing to his friend Link, he expresses the hope that no definite
concessions will be made to the opposition; Christ will transform all
offers "into a lance by which to play a deceptive game with the
opponents who intend to play us false; Christ is preparing their
destruction in the Red Sea."#footnote[Köstlin-Kawerau, #emph[M. Luther];,
Vol. II, p. 237.]

In a more considerate tone he pleads with Melanchthon, who is burdened
with so many cares, to furnish him with more accurate information; for
he fears that he will be made a victim of violence and deception.

In order to console Spengler, his informant from Nuremberg, who had
indulged in laments, he wrote to him: "Though Christ may appear to be
somewhat weak, this does not mean that He is pushed out of His seat …In
the proviso concerning the Gospel, there are embodied snares
(#emph[insidiae];) other than those which our adversaries can employ
against us."#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. II, p. 385.] Hence,
in the last analysis, the proviso concerning the Gospel and its secret
snares (#emph[insidiae];) was expected to save everything. This means:
No agreement may be regarded as valid or binding if it runs counter to
the new gospel, even though such concessions are made.

In the meantime events at Augsburg followed the course we have already
described.

The greatest sensation was produced by Melanchthon’s concession to
recognize the jurisdiction of the bishops under certain conditions.

In treating of this proposal, Luther, on September 23, writes to his
confidant, Nicholas Hausmann, to the effect that the main condition for
the recognition of episcopal jurisdiction was this, that the bishops
"were to attend to the teaching of the Gospel"; and he adds in all
seriousness that nothing had been done in this direction and hence his
enemies had conjured up their own
destruction.#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, VIII, p. 269; Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, Vol. II, pp. 387 sq.] He speaks as if the concession was
not a mere pretense.

Still more characteristic is Luther’s excuse after the close of the
diet, addressed to Landgrave Philip of Hesse in response to the latter’s
complaint. Here he frankly admits the true nature of the proposed
recognition of episcopal jurisdiction: It was not at all to be feared
that this proposal would be accepted; moreover, it never could have been
accepted; but, he avers, it served "to raise our repute still further"
(#emph[i.e.];, to capture public opinion). The offer would have been a
mistake only if it had been adopted. Philip, therefore, ought to be
satisfied; in his next work, he (Luther) proposes to discuss at length
the unfairness of his opponents.#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, VIII, p.
295; Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. II, p. 388.]

In this work, entitled "Warning," he actually boasts of the conciliatory
attitude of his partisans at Augsburg. Nevertheless, all peace overtures
were lost upon those obstinate men. "Our offers, our prayers, our cries
for peace" were all wasted.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp. 388–389.]

The real nature of the "proviso of the Gospel" is revealed only if due
consideration is given to all these texts.

Towards the end of his sojourn at the castle of Coburg, Luther was
visited by Martin Bucer and John Frederick, the son and future successor
of the Elector of Saxony. Both found him in comparatively good health.
His exterior appearance had changed, due to a long beard which he wore
until his return to Wittenberg. Bucer’s object was to effect an approach
between his party, which sympathized with Zwingli, and Luther, relative
to the controversy on the Eucharist.

He by his artful diplomacy succeeded in impressing Luther favorably by
means of a vague formula on the Real Presence. After the termination of
the diet, Luther probably hoped to resist the Emperor with a more
numerous and more compact following. Prince John Frederick, eager to
show his respects to Luther, presented him with a precious signet-ring
bearing the latter’s "escutcheon,"–a heart overlayed with a cross in the
midst of a rose. Luther at once found a mystical interpretation for this
symbol, by referring it to his doctrine and position.

With a certain resignation he discussed with these and other callers the
unfavorable decision of the diet. In reality, and as a matter of course,
he did not expect and could not have expected any other. In his letters
he now entrusted everything to Providence.” His letters and writings at
this period contain pious and beautiful sentiments and abound in phrases
calculated to console himself and his friends.

Some historians love to extol the excellence of the prayers which he
composed during his solitude. Among others they refer to a collection of
exhortations which he compiled at that time. It is, in reality, a
treasury of elevating thoughts, taken from Holy Writ to arouse
confidence in God.#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXX, ii, pp. 700 sqq.; Erl.
ed., Vol. XXIII, pp. 154 sq. Cf. Haussleiter in the #emph[Neue
Kirchliche Zeitschrift];, 1917, Pp. 149 sqq.] It is apparent at once,
however, that all the texts have been selected to serve as a defense and
confirmation of the personal standpoint which Luther assumed in his
contentions. The same is true of most of his prayers. They are designed
to corroborate his presumptive right. Every true prayer ought to
contain, above all else, a petition to know and bow before the will of
God, even as related to the whole conception of life. In the prayers
which Luther composed such willingness is hardly detectable. He will not
concede the possibility that another course besides the one which he has
entered upon may be the right one.

This observation is applicable also to the frequently cited prayer which
Vitus Dietrich is supposed to have heard from Luther’s lips, and which
culminates in the words addressed to God: "Thou hast power to extirpate
the persecutors of Thy children; if Thou dost not do-it, the danger is
Thine. What we have done, we had to do."#footnote[Cfr. Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, original German ed., Vol. III, p. 998.]

Such is not the spirit of resignation as expressed in the #emph[fiat
voluntas tua];, the basis and crown of all prayer; but it is a command
addressed to God to do the bidding of the supplicant. Dietrich, who was
an enthusiastic disciple, also tells us that Luther, while sojourning in
the castle of Coburg, devoted at least three hours daily to prayer. It
is not unlikely that many an hour may have been spent by him in sighing
for relief, especially when he was unfit for work and in periods of
protracted sickness and spiritual affliction. Moreover, his work of
translation undoubtedly offered him many opportunities of meditating on
the Psalms and other Biblical texts. Hence, it is probable that his
customary prayer may have often been protracted. But it is difficult to
believe that Luther devoted himself regularly to prayers for more than
three hours daily. The strenuous literary work which he performed
demanded a most diligent use of time.
