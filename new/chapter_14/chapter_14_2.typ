== The Schmalkaldic League After 1531
<the-schmalkaldic-league-after-1531>
The military League of Schmalkalden was initiated as early as February
27, 1531, by John of Saxony and Duke Ernest of Braunschweig at the
instigation of the jurists. It was completed at Schmalkalden on March
29, when the remaining members affixed their seal to the document.
Besides the rulers of electoral Saxony and Braunschweig-Lüneburg, there
were affiliated with it Landgrave Philip of Hesse, Prince Wolfgang of
Anhalt, Counts Gebhard and Albrecht of Mansfeld, and the cities of
Strasburg, Ulm, Constance, Reutlingen, Memmingen, Lindau, Biberach,
Isny, Lübeck, Magdeburg, and Bremen. Others joined the league later. The
members bound themselves by an oath to come to the relief of any member
attacked on account of the Gospel or on any other
pretext.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. I, p. 64.]

Thus a wedge was driven into the unity of the German nation at the
expense of its internal strength and external development. The
Protestants were now a united political power. What Landgrave Philip and
Elector John had commenced when they formed their military alliance at
Gotha, in 1526, was now completed. The defense of the interests of the
religious innovation passed from Luther and his theologians to the
secular authorities; and the latter knew well how to pursue their
selfish interests with advantage.

Luther may have been glad to remain somewhat in the background when the
League was formed. The jurists and rulers were promoting his cause. If
the League should prove disastrous for Germany –which actually
happened–his gospel would be less exposed to criticism. Nevertheless, he
had to reckon with the decline of his popularity due to the existence of
the League. In no small measure he forfeited the direction of his work
because of the action of the political rulers.

Schmalkalden was a small city in Hesse, situated south of Eisenach in
the administrative area of Prussia. Enclosed in a pleasant valley, where
the Stille flows into the Schmalkalde (a tributary of the Werra), the
town presents a peaceful scene, in strong contrast with the
recollections of the religious struggles in which it played a role.
Verdant hills surround the city, the Rotberg and the Giefelsberg to the
north, the Wolfsberg and the Grasberg to the south. To the east rises a
hill, on which was enthroned the ancient castle of Walrab, which is now
reconstructed into the stately Wilhelmsschloss. The city was encircled
by a wall which has almost completely disappeared. Within its bosom the
parochial church of St. George raised aloft its two spires; they are of
a late Gothic design, and are still well preserved. The venerable church
testifies to the pious and vigorous Catholic life that prevailed before
the Protestant Reformation. The sessions of the Schmalkaldic League were
held in the old-fashioned town-hall, which is still partially preserved.
Luther resided in a Patrician house at the foot of the castle-hill,
which still exists. Here he participated in the convention of the
estates and theologians in 1537. The residence of Melanchthon, known as
"Rosenapotheke," impresses the eye of present-day visitors with its
antique style of architecture.

A Zwinglian element had entered this city, dominated by Lutheranism at
the time the widowed sister of Philip of Hesse, Elizabeth von
Sachsen-Rochlitz, took up her abode in it. Her name is association with
the change of the city to the religion of the so-called Swiss reformers.
In the parish church, which was at one time richly decorated with
statues, the empty pedestals bear mute evidence to the work of
destruction wrought by the Zwinglian vandals. After these iconoclasts
had vented their fury on the altars, statues, reliquaries and other
works of sacred art, a train of wagons bearing religious objects wended
its way up the hill behind the Wilhelmsschloss, where the fanatical mob
consigned them to the flames.
