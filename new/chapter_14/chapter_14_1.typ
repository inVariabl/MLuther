== Luther’s Change of Opinion Relative to Armed Resistance
<luthers-change-of-opinion-relative-to-armed-resistance>
After the diet of Augsburg, a striking change took place in Luther’s
attitude toward the question of armed resistance to the Emperor. The
stringent measures of the "Reichskammergericht" announced in the
"Abschied" of the diet against the secularization of Catholic church
property and the rigorous steps which were generally adopted against the
new religion, produced a definite attitude on the part of Protestants.
The jurists of Electoral Saxony expressed themselves to Chancellor Brück
increasingly in favor of preparedness and forceful resistance to the
imperial mandates. Philip of Hesse, who had formed ambitious projects
against the Emperor, was prepared to open hostilities at the first
favorable opportunity and counted on the support of all those who shared
his ideas.

Luther personally would have preferred a policy of watchful waiting
without the use of violence. He held that the execution of the
resolutions adopted at Augsburg should be demonstrated as impossible by
permitting the innovations to progress in a peaceful way. He would have
been pleased if things had been left as they were and time thus gained
for the further propagation of the new gospel. However, circumstances
forced him to change his attitude—a change which led to
self-contradiction and open sanction of that armed resistance which he
had previously condemned.

His former teaching had been that it was not permissible to meet
violence with violence, especially against the Emperor; that, according
to the gospel, unjust persecution was to be suffered with Christian
resignation and in the expectation of final assistance from above.
Despite his blustering, various reasons determined him to issue such
declarations repeatedly. In the first place, he was influenced by the
after-effects of the mystical idealism which he had developed in the
monastery, and according to which the kingdom of God knew only a
yielding disposition, humility, and submission; every true Christian
must allow himself to be "oppressed and disgraced," but the defense of
rights was the business of the secular authorities. In addition, he had
firmly persuaded himself that God would and must prosper his cause.
Luther was convinced that he was right and, consequently, enjoyed the
protection of Heaven, while, on the other hand he "knew" that "the
Emperor is not and cannot be sure of his cause."#footnote[Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, Vol. III, pp. 47 sq.]

Secondly, he was influenced by the consideration that, if military force
were to be invoked in support of his gospel, the prospects of success on
the part of the princes who favored him were unfavorable and that the
frightful misfortune of war had better be averted for humanitarian
reasons. "May God preserve us from such a
horror!"#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 49.]

He exclaims, since, as he puts it, a breach and disturbance of the
public peace would be "a stain on our doctrine."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];,
p. 45.] His religious innovations would more readily recommend
themselves to the princes if they made their way as peaceably as
possible, without any disturbance and conflict.

Hence his assertion, repeated particularly during the first years after
his apostasy, that the Word alone must accomplish all things, and his
appeal to "the breath of Christ," which, according to the Bible, is to
destroy Antichrist. Even as late as 1530, Elector John of Saxony was in
complete accord with Luther’s idea that armed resistance to the Emperor
was unlawful.#footnote[Köstlin-Kawerau, #emph[M. Luther];, Vol. II, p.
249.]

Nevertheless, it is well known that, from the beginning, Luther allowed
himself again and again to clamor for war. It was a demand born of his
agitated temperament and his ardent zeal for his gospel. Thus, in 1522,
he declared that "every power must yield to the
Gospel."#footnote[Grisar, Luther, Vol. II1, p. 76.]

"Not only the spiritual, but also the secular power, must yield to the
Gospel whether cheerfully or otherwise." "Not a hair’s breadth will I
yield to the opponents"; and: "If war will ensue, let there be war"
(1530). "If Germany will perish, if it will go to rack and ruin, how can
I help it? I cannot save it." In 1523 he had already conceded to the
Elector Frederick the right to bear arms in defense of the new doctrine,
provided he did this "at the call of a singular spirit and faith," not
as a Christian prince engaged in his own affairs, but as a stranger who
comes to the rescue. In an opinion which he rendered for the successor
of Frederick, in 1529, he said: "There must be no resistance unless
actual violence is done or dire necessity compels."#footnote[The cited
passages #emph[ibid.];, pp. 45–50.]

These utterances laid the foundation for the change of mind which came
over him in 1531.

He was still wavering when, just prior to the assembly of the diet of
Augsburg, he explained to his Elector in a rather lengthy memorandum
that military resistance "can in no wise be reconciled with Scripture."
"In the confusion and tumult which would ensue," he says, "everyone
would want to be emperor, and what horrible bloodshed and misery would
that not cause!" "A Christian ought to be ready to suffer violence and
injustice, more particularly from his own ruler." It were preferable to
sacrifice life and limb, #emph[i.e.];, endure martyrdom.”#footnote[Erl.
ed., Vol. LIV, pp. 138 sq. (#emph[Briefwechsel];, VII, p. 239); Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, Vol. III, p. 52.] It seems that he was at that time very
much frightened at the thought of the "disgrace" which would attach to
his doctrine if it stirred up a religious war. This memorandum was
formulated after Luther had conferred with his three advisers, Jonas,
Bugenhagen, and Melanchthon. It was, however, kept secret, perhaps in
order to avoid any friction with the electoral jurists, who were rather
inclined to war. An abstract was sent only to Spengler at Nuremberg,
which city was likewise disposed to disapprove of resistance.

This memorandum caused the adherents of the new religion great
embarrassment later on, after Luther had changed his mind and the
Protestant Estates, appealing to his authority had entered the
Schmalkaldic War. Cochlaeus obtained its text, and published it with
glosses directed against its vacillating author. The courageous abbot,
Paul Bachmann of Altenzelle, appended a reply to Luther, in which he
says that Luther had ever raved against the Emperor and the Pope, as
though they were worse than the Turks; but in this memorandum, "being
apprehensive of resistance, the old serpent turns round and faces its
tail, simulating a false humility, patience, and reverence for the
authorities, and says: A Christian must be ready to endure violence from
his ruler."#footnote[Grisar, #emph[op. cit.];, Vol. III, p. 63.] Driven
into a corner, Luther’s advisers, who had approved the memorandum,
shortly after his demise tried to impugn its authenticity. Melanchthon
did so incidentally, Bugenhagen of set purpose, for which he was justly
reproved in public by Ratzeberger, a well-informed friend of
Luther.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 74]

The rapidity with which Luther changed his mind after formulating the
above-mentioned memorandum was chiefly owing to the decision of the diet
of Augsburg which was so unfavorable to him. His inclination to offer
resistance manifests itself at once in his "Warning" to his dear
Germans, which he composed shortly after the close of the diet and which
has been discussed above, as well as in the tract which he penned
against "the assassin of Dresden."

At the end of October, 1530, he was obliged to repair to Torgau with
Melanchthon and Jonas for a conference concerning the question of
resistance. There he met the legal advisers of his territorial lord and,
perhaps, those of other princes. He was unable to resist their
influence. At first he refused to declare himself, claiming that the
question did not concern him, since it was his sole duty as a theologian
to teach Christ. The laws of the Empire ought to be obeyed; what these
were, he neither knew nor cared to know. But the jurists insisted that
he express an opinion on a lengthy document which they had drawn up in
justification of war. After enumerating alleged juridical and
theological reasons, this document asserted that the "proceedings and
acts" of the Emperor "were in contravention of law"; that, so far as the
decision of this matter is concerned, he was "but a private individual."
Luther did not contradict them, but placed the responsibility upon the
jurists, leaving them to proceed as they pleased. Conjointly with
Melanchthon and Jonas he declared that, up to now, he and the
theologians, precisely as theologians, had taught that it was "not right
to offer outright resistance to the authorities," but they did not know
that, as the jurists pointed out, the authorities themselves conferred
the right of armed resistance in cases such as that under consideration.
Hence, they could "not quote the Bible against such resistance, when
necessary for defense, even if it were against the Emperor in person."
Taking these things into consideration, all three declared that the
warlike preparations were justified.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];]

In writing about this affair to Link, Luther said: "In no wise have we
counseled the use of force. But if the Emperor by virtue of his laws
concedes the right of resistance in such a case, then let him bear the
consequences." In that event, he says, the princes, #emph[qua] princes,
and in this capacity only, may offer resistance. "To a Christian,
nothing \[of that sort\] is lawful, for he is dead to the
world."#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, VIII, p. 344; January 15, 1531;
Grisar, Luther, Vol. II, p. 60.]

These vexatious and threadbare explanations did not, however, satisfy
Link and his followers at Nuremberg, who continued to side with Spengler
in his stand against resistance. Neither would the people of the
margravate of Brandenburg listen to this over-refined casuistry, but
persisted in their refusal to offer resistance. Luther relied all the
more on his pretext, that this question should be decided by the
politicians and jurists; that he, as a theologian, was obliged to
refrain from offering advice; and said he abstained from offering
counsel for reasons of a more lofty piety; and that he would have the
entire matter rest not on "the power of man," but on that of God; for,
then only "it would turn out well, even if it be a downright error and
sin."#footnote[Letter to a citizen of Nuremberg, March 18, 1531; Erl.
ed, Vol. LIV, p. 221 (#emph[Briefwechsel];, VIII, p. 378); Grisar,
#emph[op. cit.];, III, p. 62.] Despite these extenuating phrases, the
jurists, as was to be expected, made use of his declaration given at
Torgau as a simple and complete acquiescence in their endeavor to bring
about the formation of the military League of Schmalkalden. Spengler,
who had a copy of Luther’s opinion of March, 1530, in which he strictly
declined to approve of resistance, wrote from Nuremberg that he was
amazed "that Doctor Martin should so contradict himself."#footnote[See
Enders in #emph[Briefwechsel];, VIII, p. 298; Grisar, #emph[op. cit.];,
p. 59.] Besides the pressure of the jurists, the following circumstances
may have contributed to change Luther’s attitude: First, the prospect of
successful resistance as a result of the increased opposition to Rome,
especially in consequence of the defection of England initiated at that
time, and the prospective Protestantization of Württemburg; secondly,
the Emperor’s preoccupation with the hostile king of France; and,
finally, the weakness and indecision of some of the Catholic estates
which manifested itself at the diet of Augsburg.

As a matter of fact, Luther waxed ever more positive in his demand for
armed resistance after 1531.

"We may not deviate a hair’s breadth on the plea of disturbing the
public peace," he wrote. "We must trust in God, who has thus far
protected His Church during the most terrible wars."#footnote[Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, Vol. III, pp. 78 sq.] In 1536, subscribing to a document
which emphasized the duty to offer armed resistance for the protection
of the Gospel, he said: "I, Martin Luther, will do my best by prayer
and, if needs be, with the fist."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 433.]

In his excitability and tempestuous nature he even demanded the
infliction of the death penalty upon the pope and his rabble,
#emph[i.e.];, his defenders. In 1540, he gave notice that there was no
other choice "but to take up arms in common against all the monks and
shavelings; I too shall join in, for it is right to slay the miscreants
like mad dogs."#footnote[#emph[Op cit.];, Vol. VI, p. 247.] In this same
year he also said: "We shall not prevail against the Turks unless we
slay them in time, together with the priests, and even hurl them to
death."#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol. III, p. 69. Cfr. Grisar and
Heege, #emph[Luthers Kampfbilder];, n. 4 (#emph[Lutherstudien];), pp.
138 sq., where more pertinent passages as well as Luther’s cartoon: "The
Pope and the Cardinals on the Gallows," may be found (p. 32); cfr. also
#emph[ibid.];, n. 31.] Neither in this nor in similar passages is there
any question of defense against force, but rather advocacy of bloody
aggression. Yet, even if these ravings are outburst of impetuous anger,
and not the expressions of calm deliberation, they indicate a deplorable
state of mind and served upon occasion to justify the bloody crimes
which resulted from the conflict between the advancing party of
religious reform and the defenders of the old order.
