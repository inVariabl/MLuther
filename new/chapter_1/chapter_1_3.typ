== Luther as a Student at Erfurt
<luther-as-a-student-at-erfurt>
Young Luther was next concerned with his reception into one of the
existing students’ inns of the university town. "Burses" or
"contubernia" were terms used to designate the homes to which all
students of the Alma Mater were obliged to belong, in virtue of a
time-honored prescription. Here they usually lived under the supervision
of one of the masters of the university. Aided by the master, or by
someone else, the students were directed in their scientific pursuits.
By the payment of a small tuition fee they had board and lodging in
common. At first Luther resided in the "burse" known as Porta Coeli,
which he afterwards exchanged for that of St. George in the parish of
that name. Thus St. George, the patron saint of his Mansfeld parish,
accompanied him also on his road to knowledge. In a verbose letter, the
earliest preserved from his pen, Luther announced his residence at the
Porta Coeli to his paternal friend Braun at Eisenach. He signs "Martinus
viropolitanus" (Martin of Mansfeld), and refers to himself as the
"bothersome hair-splitter,"–an allusion, no doubt, to his inclination to
criticize.#footnote[Letter of September 5, 1501, with excuse for delay.

Erfurt at that time enjoyed an eminent reputation for learning. Since
the university of Prague, in consequence of the Hussite controversy and
the consequent emigration of the Germans, had lost its exalted position
in the academic world, Erfurt was called the New Prague. Its faculty of
law in particular became celebrated. No less distinguished were the
members of the philosophical faculty and its preparatory courses in the
quadrivium of the liberal arts. In respect of the study of philosophy,
strictly speaking, Luther came under the influence of two excellent
teachers, Jodocus Trutvetter and Bartholomew Arnoldi of Usingen. Prior
to his admission to the higher branches of learning, custom constrained
him to complete the study of grammar, rhetoric, and poetics. This
preparatory discipline was indispensable for those students whose
knowledge of these branches of learning was incomplete. Martin, though
he was well versed in these branches, availed himself of this course in
order to perfect his style, as evidenced by the fluent Latinity of his
later writings as well as his early letters. He endeavored to catch the
spirit of the classical authors. Among the poets, he first familiarized
himself with the writings of an excellent neo-Latin poet, who was highly
celebrated in his day, Baptista Mantuanus, whose real name was Giovanni
Spagnolo. At one time general of the Carmelite Order, he was a pious and
austere man, who was later beatified by Leo XIII. In due course of time
Luther read Ovid’s Heroics or Love Epistles and the poems of Vergil. The
study of scholastic theology, he asserts, prevented him from reading
more of these authors. This statement, however, is not to be accepted
literally, for he found time to read the comedies of Plautus, and,
either at the same time or somewhat later, Horace, Juvenal, and Terence,
from whom he was able to quote in his later years. Jerome Emser, his
subsequent adversary, explained to him Reuchlin’s comedy of "Sergius."

The so-called "minor logic" constituted a part of the subject matter of
the first lectures in the faculty of liberal arts. The Old and the New
Logic, interpreted by the aid of Aristotle, was the next step in his
studies. With the Stagirite as a guide, the student then learned
“natural philosophy, #emph[i. e.];, the physics of Aristotle, and read
his treatises on the soul and on spherical astronomy. Although the
subjects of the ancient trivium still pertained to the faculty of arts,
the subjects of the quadrivium were freely treated. The lectures were
delivered in the "burses" or in the auditorium of the so-called Old
College. They were accompanied by constant exercises and disputations.
These "exercises and disputations" often commenced as early as six in
the morning; they stimulated industry, sharpened the wits, and
cultivated the faculty of oral expression.

In this respect, too, the faculty of arts of the University of Erfurt
revealed itself as a medium of a general academic training, well adapted
to the requirements of the age, preparing the student for the higher
branches of learning, theology, jurisprudence, or medicine. Aristotle,
who was celebrated almost universally as the Philosopher, was the
supreme pathfinder to scholarly independence.

The bachelor’s degree, the lowest academic honor, was the proximate aim
of Luther. He obtained this degree as soon as possible, in the autumn of
1502, by means of a severe test in the presence of five examiners. As
"baccalaureate of the liberal arts" he now wore the gown of his office
according to the constitutions of the faculty, since he was now a member
of the teaching staff. This first academic distinction prepared the way
for the master’s degree. But, before he could achieve this honor, it was
necessary for him to devote himself to protracted study. In the meantime
he was obliged to assist beginners in the studies he had completed. This
was the rule of the university. A strict law regulated the curriculum of
studies and the scientific occupation of the teachers at the
universities of that day.

Nevertheless, a certain freedom of life prevailed, and the students
found frequent opportunities for pleasantries and merriment.

Young Luther had experienced this at the very threshold of his academic
career, when he was obliged, like all newcomers, to take the so-called
"deposition" in order to become a full-fledged student in the eyes of
his associates. On this occasion the newcomer (#emph[Bean];) was
compelled to masquerade with horns and elongated ears, and swine’s teeth
were attached to the corners of his mouth. Then, by means of a plane, he
was fashioned into the proper academic form. The merry procedure was
crowned by a baptism with water or wine. Originally a certain spiritual
significance had been attached to this ceremony: it was intended to hold
up to the freshman the moral aims which he was to pursue through the
renunciation of his shortcomings. When Luther was professor at
Wittenberg in later years, he alluded to the symbolic meaning of this
"deposition."

The life of the beneficiaries of the various "burses" was invested with
manifold privileges. Although the constitutions of some, #emph[e. g.];,
the Porta Coeli, were strict and decisive in their religious and
educational import, they were not always conscientiously observed. In
comparison with the beginnings of the "burses," there was possibly a
lack of zeal and vigilance in Luther’s student days. In some instances,
the frequentation of taverns was expressly permitted. The life of the
students at Erfurt must have been rather unrestrained. The relatively
large number of students (at that time an average of over 300 were
enrolled annually) leads us to expect excesses. In 1530 Luther says that
the University of Erfurt was "a place of dissolute living and an
ale-house," in which subjects the students were interested in preference
to everything else.#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., II, Nr.
2719b.] His added remark that "there were neither lecturers nor
preachers" at this institution, is evidently to be characterized as a
polemical exaggeration directed against a Catholic university. For there
were deserving preachers at Erfurt, though they did not preach the new
Gospel; and there were also respectable professors, as he himself
attests in his reference to Trutvetter and Usingen. Nevertheless, the
acrid judgment just cited reveals a modicum of evil experiences made at
Erfurt. The city council in a measure harbored immorality by allowing
prostitutes to live together upon the payment of a tax, a custom which
prevailed also in other cities. Even among the clergy of Erfurt there
were open infractions of chastity. It is questionable, however, whether
Luther meant Erfurt, when in his #emph[Table Talks] he said he knew a
city where the mistresses of clergymen were honored as Madame Deaconess,
Madame Provost, Madame Cantor, etc.#footnote[Erlangen ed., LX, p. 280
(Chap. 27, Nr. 1301).] "Gossip may have seized upon many a story and
embellished it with its own peculiar frivolity," says Otto
Scheel.#footnote[Scheel, I, p. 136.] When, at a later period, Luther
speaks of his own youth he states that the clergy were not suspected of
adultery and immorality, whereas, since then, dissoluteness had
constantly increased.#footnote[#emph[Opp. Exeg.];, IX, p. 260.] At all
events, Erfurt, during the student days of Luther, was a city whose
inhabitants observed the moral law and were imbued with a profound
religious faith–a city replete with well-attended churches and numerous
busy monasteries whose bells never ceased ringing by day and by night.

The splendid church of Our Lady excelled all other churches. Erected on
a hill, it overlooked the entire city. The church of St. Severus, which
was situated next to it, still presents a magnificent sight. A few
decades before Luther used to visit this church, St. John Capistran
preached from the lower steps of the mighty terrace which leads up to
the hill, and stories were told of numerous conversions and miraculous
cures. In the year 1502, while Luther was present, the city and the
plaza witnessed the solemn procession of the jubilee which was arranged
under the auspices of the papal legate, Raymond Peraudi of Gurk,
accompanied by the general reception of the Sacraments and a plenary
indulgence. Like the jubilee indulgence granted on a previous occasion,
in 1488, that of 1502 was a source of spiritual renovation for citizens
and students. For a number of years the voice of an Augustinian monk,
John Genser (Jenser) von Paltz, - the scholarly promoter of papal
indulgences, resounded through the spacious edifice. He was a profoundly
pious man, endowed with a powerful gift of speech. His associate, the
Augustinian John von Dorsten, rivaled him as a preacher of great
popularity and impressive forcefulness. Indeed, the Augustinian
monastery excelled all others in learning and practical activity. By
means of their confraternities, monasteries, and churches, these monks
educated the faithful to a more active religious life. Perhaps young
Luther, the son of a miner, may have experienced a sort of predilection
for the confraternity of St. Ann, the patroness of miners, which was
directed by the Augustinians. We shall see that he supplicated St. Ann,
when, during a storm, he made his vow to enter a monastery.

But, until that time, he devoted two years to preparing himself for the
master’s degree. During this time he studied the logic of Aristotle,
certain questions of natural philosophy, mathematics in general, and
several minor branches of the old quadrivium; and, finally, moral
philosophy, politics, and metaphysics. All these subjects were learned
in the light of Aristotle and with the assistance of preceptors who
explained the writings of the Stagirite to the student.#footnote[Cf,
Scheel, I, pp. 157 sqq.; 170 sqq., where the branches of study are set
forth in detail for the period before and after the baccalaureate.]

In its application of the Aristotelian philosophy, and in the study of
philosophy in general, the University of Erfurt claimed to pursue a
purified course, which at that time was designated as "modern."
Trutvetter and Usingen, the principal teachers of Luther, were outspoken
representatives of the #emph[via moderna];, as were also their fellow
instructors. At other universities there were advocates of the new as
well as adherents of the old method. The old system favored the
so-called philosophy of realism, whereas the new system betrayed a
nominalistic tendency. The latter originally derived its name from the
fact that it held that all universal concepts were mere names (nomina.)
The better class of Nominalists were strictly Catholic and avoided the
dangers ordinarily attached to Nominalism. William of Ockham, the daring
and skeptical "#emph[Doctor invincibilis];" (died at Munich in 1347),
was the accepted leader of the Nominalist school. But there were men
like the learned and influential Gabriel Biel, as well as the Erfurt
professors mentioned above, who knew how to avoid the reefs of
Ockhamism.

Nominalism was a stage in the decline of Scholasticism. The heyday of
Scholasticism was past; logical investigations and useless hairsplitting
were in vogue. The barren subtleties of Terminism, so-called, were an
evil, though a very large and living stream of learning was still
flowing. The Scholastics of the thirteenth century, especially Thomas of
Aquin, who followed a moderate realism, had offered a better foundation
and, according to content and form, a better school. St. Thomas had
brought the Aristotelian philosophy into a better organic union with
Catholic truth. But his writings were not properly utilized. We shall
see how certain deficiencies of his Erfurt training avenged themselves
upon Luther. In many respects he claimed to be a consistent Ockhamite;
in some points he went beyond him, in others he abandoned him. It is
important to bear in mind, however, that he imbibed no reformatory ideas
from his teachers at Erfurt, but learned to combat the Nominalism of
Ockham, wherever it deviated from true philosophy to the detriment of
dogma.

The same attitude was maintained toward the authority of Aristotle.
Although he reigned supreme in natural philosophy, the Catholic school
contradicted his theses as far as they were in conflict with the
Christian faith. Divine revelation as a source of knowledge was rightly
regarded as inviolable against the objections of pagan philosophy.

As yet Luther had not occupied himself with the study of the Sacred
Scriptures, with which he was acquainted only through the widely spread
excerpts of the #emph[postillae] or #emph[plenaria];. These books, which
contained principally the pericopes of the Sunday gospels and epistles,
as well as the very sententious so-called history-bibles, all composed
in German, were in the hands of the clergy and laity.

Luther relates in his #emph[Table Talks] how, while yet a student at
Erfurt, he accidentally happened upon a complete Bible, and how the Old
Testament story of Anna, the mother of Samuel, made him realize what
inspiring narratives were contained in the historical books of the Old
Testament.#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., I, Nr. xxs;. ITI,
Nr. 3767; 5, Nr. 5346. I see no reason to doubt this statement.] The
book with which he became acquainted on that occasion, was a volume of
the university library. He was unable to read the whole Bible at the
time, but he felt a lively desire to make himself more familiar with the
Sacred Scriptures. But the great expense of a complete Bible in those
days, when the art of printing was in its infancy, permitted him to buy
only a #emph[postilla] for his own use. He was amazed to discover many
passages which did not appear in the liturgy of the Church. According to
his own testimony, Luther was twenty years of age when he made his first
acquaintance with the complete Bible. This late discovery, however, is
not surprising. How many persons twenty years of age may there have
been, even among the highly educated, who never had a complete Bible in
their hands, and how many such individuals might not be found today?
There was no reason for Protestant writers to adorn the story of this
event with romantic embellishments and to assert that Luther then and
there became the great discoverer of the Bible, which, in the days that
preceded his birth, lay hidden under a bench and fastened to a chain. At
most it was fastened to a chain in this sense that it was secured for
the sake of safety and general utility. Even at the present day, all
manuscripts in the Laurentian Library of Florence are secured by a
chain.

Luther also informs us that once, when he and a companion journeyed to
Mansfeld, he injured his leg with the sword, which he, ‘as a bachelor,
was wont to carry as a badge of his academic status. The accident
happened half a mile from Erfurt, and blood flowed so profusely from the
wound that he was in danger of death. He lay helpless on the ground,
pressing the swelling wound with his hand until his companion had
summoned a surgeon from the city, who bandaged the wound. At death’s
door, he tells us, he imploded the aid of the Mother of God. "Then would
I have died, placing full confidence in the help of Mary." In his room
at Erfurt, the following night, the wound broke open. Feeling faint, he
once more invoked the Bl. Virgin Mary. While lying convalescent on his
bed, he sought distraction by learning to play the lute, an
accomplishment which he ever afterwards
cherished.#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., V, Nr. 6428. Cf. I,
Nr. 119.]

The playing of the lute proved a great advantage to him. It helped him
to dispel a natural tendency to melancholia, and also enabled him to
amuse and entertain his fellow-students. Crotus Rubeanus, who in later
years became a celebrated free-thinker, was a room-mate of Luther’s. In
a letter to the latter, dated April 28, 1520, Crotus writes: "You were
at one time the musician, you were the learned philosopher in my
contubernium."#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, II, p. 391.] This
statement reveals not only Luther’s musical accomplishment, but also his
zeal in the pursuit of his studies. His success in philosophy was
especially esteemed by his fellow-students. Mathesius ascribed to him "a
great earnestness and special diligence" in his studies. "Though
naturally an alert and jovial young fellow," he says, "yet he commenced
his studies every morning with prayer and a visit to the church."
Mathesius writes this in his sermons on Luther in order to represent the
piety of his young companion as exemplary.#footnote[Mathesius, p. 19.
The laudatory expression of Crotus also serves a partisan purpose.]

Luther at this time had deeply-rooted Christian convictions as well as
loyalty to the clergy and the head of the Church. The
anti-ecclesiastical ideas of Ockham were completely alien to him.
According to his subsequent declarations, he dismissed, by means of
prayer and acts of faith, the objections to the teaching of the Church
which he occasionally met with in Ockham’s works. He heard bitter
complaints about the condition of the Church, but they did not produce
any impression upon him at the time. An old man from Meiningen, with
whose son, who was also a student at Erfurt, Luther was well acquainted,
visited him during his illness and spoke to him about a great change
which was bound to come, since the present state of affairs could not
continue. When Luther complained of his indisposition, the man consoled
him, saying: "Do not feel aggrieved, you will be a great man some day."
Luther mentions this conversation in his #emph[Table Talks] for the year
1532, and comments upon it as follows: "There I heard a prophet." "I
mean," he adds, "that the change of which the old man spoke, has taken
place."#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., I, Nr. 223; II, Nr.
1368, 2520. The visitor designated in these passages probably was one
and the same person.] Such fanciful prophecies as those of the man of
Meiningen and of Hilten of Eisenach, captivated him, not in his student
days, but in later life.

During 1503 and 1504 his mind was absorbed by his efforts to qualify
himself for the attainment of the degree of master of arts. At the
beginning of 1505, he took the examination, which was held around the
feast of Epiphany. Among the seventeen students who were examined,
Luther took second honors. The examination was followed by the solemn
presentation of the insignia of the master’s office, a brown biretta and
a ring. Luther informs us that on such occasions the new masters were
publicly honored amid great pomp. At eventide, accompanied by
torch-bearers, they rode horseback through the city amid flourish of
trumpets, the noisy acclamation of the populace, and the pleasures of
Bacchus. They were obliged to give a supper to the faculty, for which,
characteristically enough, the minimum and not the maximum number of
participants was designated.

In compliance with his father’s wishes, Luther, now a master of arts,
entered the faculty of law. He commenced to study in preparation for the
secular career which his parents had chosen for him. His father was even
planning an advantageous marriage for him. Formerly he addressed his
son, while yet a bachelor, with the familiar personal pronoun "du"
(you); but henceforth he addressed him with the honorary title "Ihr"
(you). With a great outlay he purchased a #emph[Corpus Juris] for the
young law student. The faculty of jurisprudence of the University of
Erfurt in those days had several professors of renown. Henning Gode in
particular was an excellent representative of Canon Law. We do not know
what lectures Luther attended during the first few months, that is, the
period which preceded his sudden entrance into the monastery. He appears
not to have been satisfied. It is fair to assume that he had no
inclination for the study of law. His subsequent strong condemnation of
lawyers and their science justify the inference of an early opposition.
Then, too, his mind was so much taken up with spiritual matters that he
regarded the lectures on law and the private studies which it entailed
as too arid, of small profit for heart and head. He did not suffer from
a lack of emotional capacity, as the near future soon revealed, but
rather possessed a superabundance of emotion, which was destined to
become dangerous for him.

Did he, perhaps, permit his philosophy of life to be influenced at that
time by the humanistic tendencies, whose history in Germany is so
intimately connected with that of the University of Erfurt? Some writers
have assumed that a very strong influence was exerted upon the
impressionable youth by the neo-humanistic movement which commenced at
that time, and which was fostered to excess by certain circles in
Erfurt. It has been alleged that the seeds of the future reformer were
sown in Luther’s soul by the poets and the untrammeled critics who had
been alienated from the Church. This view needs rectification. To a
certain extent, young Luther became surcharged with the ideas of his
age, which sought to imitate the classical form of the ancients without
becoming enthusiastic over their pagan philosophy. The school of the
trivium, especially under Trebonius at Eisenach, formally directed his
mind into that channel. His first Latin essays manifest an affected,
humanistically inspired style. Usingen and Trutvetter, his Erfurt
teachers of the "liberal arts," although Scholastics and Nominalistic
philosophers, were neither unfamiliar with nor hostile to humanism. They
cultivated the sound old German humanism which, corresponding with that
of the Middle Ages, was favored by the statutes of the University. This
was the kind of humanism of which they endeavored to learn the forms and
which fructified their ideas. It was devoid of that corrosive and
repulsive element which characterized the new humanism about to commence
at Erfurt. The movement with which Luther had affiliated himself, was
marked by a reverential attitude towards the Church. As yet he did not
study Greek, but he read the Latin classics with such enthusiasm that it
redounded to his great advantage in acquiring versatility of form in
Latin as well as in his German mother-tongue. When he entered the
monastery, he took with him the comedies of Plautus and the poems of
Vergil and disposed of all his other books to a bookseller. It was only
in proportion as his devotion to the Bible increased that his
predilection for humanism declined.

The neo-humanistic school did not assume shape at Erfurt until after the
doors of the monastery had closed behind Luther.#footnote[Proof offered
by Scheel I, pp. 223 sqq.] He was not in contact with its spirit, least
of all with the anti-ecclesiastical endeavors of the canon Mutianus
Rufus (Conrad) of Gotha, the chief of the rising neo-humanism, who,
since 1507, gradually formed more intimate connections with the Erfurt
humanists, Eobanus Hessus, Crotus Rubeanus, John Lang, Peter and Henry
Eberbach, and others. From 1515 to 1520 the neo-humanists prevailed
mightily at the University. In collaboration with the talented and
frivolous Crotus Rubeanus, they launched, in 1515, a hostile publication
against the Scholastics and the monks, which appeared under the title of
#emph[Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum];. Luther’s contact with Crotus, of
which the latter afterwards boasted, was restricted to their association
in the burse of St. George. Both were members of that small band of
young friends (#emph[consortium];) who celebrated Luther’s departure
from the University and accompanied him to the gates of the monastery.

Another humanist, George Spalatin, a native of Spalt, afterwards
Luther’s friend and most effective helper in the religious innovations,
was a student of Erfurt from 1498 to 1502, and returned thither for a
brief period in 1505 as a private tutor, when through the mediation of
Mutianus he obtained a position as teacher at the monastery of
Georgental. We have no authority for saying that this man exerted a
strong influence upon Luther during the days he spent at Erfurt while
yet a layman. But a strange tradition among Catholics in Spalt, which
originated there several decades later, attached itself to the name of
Spalatin and other natives of Spalt who associated with Luther in
Erfurt.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, III, pp. 284 sqq.] It is to the
effect that Luther, while a young monk, became enamored of the daughter
of a widow whose acquaintance he made in Spalatin’s home. This affair,
so it was alleged, was the beginning of his renunciation of the monastic
life and of the Catholic faith. It is not necessary to refute this
fable. The fall of the Augustinian friar is not to be attributed to a
desire for matrimony, but to quite other causes. The story of Luther’s
love affair in Erfurt was probably circulated by George Ferber, a native
of Spalt.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 287.]

In addition to the men mentioned above, Luther in his academic years was
associated with Caspar Schalbe, who was happy to procure Luther’s
intercession with the Elector of Saxony when accused of a crime against
morality before that sovereign in later years.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];,
1, p. 7.]

Certain declarations of his contemporaries are not favorable to Luther’s
student life. We refer to Jerome Emser of Dresden, who came in contact
with him at Erfurt, and to Jerome Dungersheim, a professor at the
university of Leipsic. Emser, who was secretary of the Duke of Saxony,
was engaged in open warfare with Luther in 1520 because of the latter’s
writings against the Catholic Church. At that time he wrote a letter to
him containing personal reproaches which is no longer preserved.
Thereupon Luther upbraided him because of his past life. Emser, indeed,
was not innocent, according to his own admission. In a counter-reply he
says, among other things: "What need was there for you to reproach me
publicly with past mistakes, most of which are inventions, because of a
letter which tells the truth about you? What do you, think is known to
me of great derelictions (#emph[flagitia];) on your part?" He did not
desire to mention these derelictions because it was not his purpose to
repay evil for evil. "That you also fell," he continues, "I believe to
be attributable to the same cause which effected my fall, namely, the
cessation in our day of that public morality which permits young men to
live as they please, unpunished, and to take all sorts of
liberties."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 27.] Luther never replied to
these reproaches.

The other witness is Dungersheim of Leipsic. He was a scholarly man and
zealous in behalf of the Church. In a printed pamphlet directed against
Luther he appeals directly to communications which, as he avers,
originated with one of the companions who escorted him to the portals of
the monastery and charges him with gross shortcomings in his student
years. Besides these reproaches, he mentions, in another polemical
writing, "bad habits" which were attributed to Luther and says it must
have been due to the latter and the neglect of prayer that Luther now
maintained the impossibility for a monk to observe his vow of
chastity.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp. 26 sq. The two documents of
Dungersheim of Ochsenfurt, quoted in this passage, were combined by him
with others in 1531 in a volume which bears the title: #emph[Aliqua
Opuscula Magistri Hieronymi Dungersheim …contra Lutherum edita];.] It
must be remembered, however, that at that time a strong sentiment
prevailed against Luther at Leipsic and many an unfavorable rumor was
launched against him which had no foundation in fact, as, for instance,
his alleged petition to the Holy See for permission to marry on the
occasion of his pilgrimage to Rome, in 1510. But Dungersheim reechoes
the report of a companion of Luther. It is possible that both witnesses
relied upon the communications of a comrade of Luther. As in the
previous instance, so now Luther preferred to ignore the allegations
made against

Luther afterwards denied that he suffered strong temptations against
chastity while he was a monk.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther] (original
German ed.), 11, p. 1003.] In his bizarre manner he repeatedly asserts
that the devil reproached him not with moral transgressions, but with
his monastic virtues and the celebration of Mass: these were the sins of
his youth. On one occasion, however, at the conclusion of his solemn
profession of the Last Supper, he concedes that he "spent his youth in a
damnable manner and lost it"; but he adds that the greatest sin he
committed was the celebration of the Mass.#footnote[Erlangen ed., XXX,
p. 371; Grisar, I, p. 27.] At another period of his later life, he once
more alludes to the sins of his youth, namely, the Mass "and this or
that youthful act"; that he often enjoyed internal "rest and good days"
until he was shaken with fright "of despair and the fear of God’s
wrath."#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., I, Nr. 141: #emph["quod
sacrificavi in missa, quod hoc aut illud feci adolescens."];]
Spiritually he often vacillated between extremes. All depended, as the
last quotation shows, on his ability to form a strong conception of
God’s mercy. Then he imagined–we speak of his later years–that "it is
only a temptation of Satan, the greatest temptation, in fact, when he
says: God hates sinners, and you are a sinner." "It is simply false that
God hates sinners." "If He hated sinners, He would not have sacrificed
His Son for them." "We have the forgiveness of sins," etc. "However,
many whom we do not know must thus struggle in the
world."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];] These violent and sudden internal
transitions are a sample of his temperament in later years.

It is possible that his soul was afflicted with a similar tension,
albeit in a milder degree, already in his youth.

While a student at Erfurt, Luther maintained friendly and stimulating
relations with his benefactors and friends at Eisenach. Trebonius, his
former teacher, inquires sympathetically of Luther’s friend, the student
Louis Han at Erfurt, concerning the welfare and progress of "my Martin."
He sends him a message encouraging him to strive after "wisdom and
discipline." The letter is one of a recently published (1916) collection
pertaining to the Eisenach circle, with whom Trebonius and Luther’s
benefactor at that place, John Braun, were associated.#footnote[Cf. note
44, #emph[supra];; Degering, p. 90, letter of February 5, 1505.]

What is still more important, some of the letters of this collection
seem to be written by Luther himself. The Latin inscription of the old
collector over the Latin letters, which had been copied in many
instances without the address or name of the sender, reads very
definitely: "Twenty-four letters of Luther and his teachers and friends
of Eisenach and Erfurt."#footnote[Degering, p. 71.] The letters were
collected shortly after 1507, supposedly at Eisenach, for the purpose of
furnishing models of style in epistolary correspondence for the use of
schools. Luther is the author of the verbose letter of the 27th or 28th
of April, 1507, in which he invites Trebonius to attend his first Mass,
and jocosely subscribes himself as "Martinus Lutherus Augustiniaster,"
an attempted witticism meaning "an inferior
Augustinian."#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, XVII, p. 84; Nr. 16 of
Degering’s collection.] Luther is also to be regarded as the author of
the letter to Braun, dated September 5, 1501, in which he speaks of the
commencement of his studies at Erfurt. It is probable that a third
letter, dated February 23, 1503, is likewise the product of his
pen.#footnote[Cf. text and note in Degering, p. 85.] The editor of the
collection refers to the spirit and mood of this letter as a proof of
Luther’s authorship. The unsigned document was addressed to a spiritual
"benefactor and dearest friend." Others have rejected this assumption on
the ground that the contents do not quite agree with what we know of
Luther the student (or rather with what some pretend to know!). An
eminent Protestant theologian, however, has taken exception to this
criticism by remarking that the supposition that Luther must have been
entirely free from the mistakes of his fellow-students has no
"historical support."#footnote[Hermann Jordan in #emph[Theologie der
Gegenwart];, 1917, pp. 158 sq.: "I regard Degering’s assumption as not
absolutely impossible; but it is as much a pure hypothesis lacking
historical support as the assumption that Luther as a student must have
been entirely free from the intemperance of his comrades."] The
recipient of the letter had praised the writer, who declines the
compliment in stilted humanistic phraseology and says that he "is
surfeited with human weakness, dereliction, and negligence in every
respect, interiorly and exteriorly," "that habit rules like a second
nature" and "the times are evil, men are worse, their works replete with
wickedness. Prevented by gluttony and drunkenness, I have hitherto
\[since my last letter?\] neither written nor read anything good; for,
being placed in the midst of men, I have lived with men. But as soon as
I had torn myself away, I at once seized my pen, in order to reply to
you, most cherished father."#footnote["#emph[Crapulis et ebrietatibus
impeditus hucusque minime quid boni scripserim aut legerim, quis
constitutus cum hominibus conversabar cum hominibus.];"] In the course
of the letter, which does not offer anything very remarkable, the writer
requests the loan of a work by Nicholas of Lyra, which he had seen in
the library of his correspondent. Reference is probably made to one of
the religious tracts of Lyra, who was famous as a Biblical commentator.
The style of the letter, both in its humanistic composition and in
various peculiarities, corresponds entirely with the two other letters
of the collection ascribed to Luther no less than with his oldest
previously known letters. The letter, moreover, harmonizes with the
above-mentioned accusations against the young student. It must be noted,
however, that a certain exaggeration attaching to the form of his
admissions is attributable to the style and character of the writer. In
a letter written to Staupitz in 1519, and in another written to
Melanchthon in 1521, Luther also complains of his gluttony, though the
expression is not to be taken in its literal sense.#footnote[Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, 11, p. 87.] The vigorous words, in which the young
student emphasizes the decline of morality,are quite as energetic as
those contained in his first lectures, sermons and letters at the
commencement of his public career.

Taking all things into consideration, it cannot be denied that young
Luther was very probably the author of the letter with which we are
concerned. In a publication on Luther which appeared in 1917, at the
time of the Luther jubilee, a certain Lutheran churchman writes: "Must
we not believe that the man who was seized with fear of sin in the
monastery, who was personally acquainted with sin, possessed a weak
heart of profound depth and obscure corners, at the sight of which he,
at times, closed his eyes with trembling, but into which he had
descended with wide-open and burning eyes when his evil hour was upon
him? Why, else, should he have experienced such biting qualms of
conscience and such indescribable fear?"#footnote[G. Tolzien,
Landessuperintendent, #emph[Martin Luther] (Schwerin, 1917), p. 4.
Tolzien seems to be ignorant of the testimonies of Emser and
Dungersheim. It is remarkable how consistently they arc passed over by
all, even scholarly, Protestant biographers of Luther.]

For the rest Luther already in his youth suffered from a natural
inclination towards melancholia. Nature, the severe discipline of his
parental home, and the first school which he attended, produced a
certain depressed atmosphere in his soul. This never quite left him,
although it was frequently interrupted by intermittent periods of great
mental uplift and inspiration. Of his inclination to religious
melancholia, not to say despair, he wrote in 1528, in a letter to one
who suffered from the same malady, that he "was not unacquainted with it
since his youth."#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, VI, p. 173.] He
regarded melancholia and despondency as the inseparable portion of man.
"Melancholia is born in us, the devil fosters the #emph[spiritus
tristitiae];."#footnote[Weimar ed., VIII, p. 574.] "From the days of my
boyhood (#emph[a pueritia mea];)," we read in the #emph[Table Talks];,
“Satan foresaw in me something of that which he must now suffer \[in
virtue of my Gospel\]. Therefore he sought with incredible frenzy to
injure and obstruct me, so much so that I often asked myself in
amazement: 'Am I the only one of all mortals whom he pursues?'
”#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., II, Nr. 12795 cf. Nr.
2342ab.]

There is another indication that a very singular temperament resided in
the highly gifted soul of Luther. This must be taken into consideration
in judging the catastrophe which drove him precipitately into a
monastery.

"Despairing of myself" (#emph[desperans de me ipso];), he tells us, he
entered the monastery.#footnote[Text from Rörers #emph[Handschriften];,
published by E. Kroker in the #emph[Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte];,
Vol. V, (1908), p. 346.]

"Internal anxiety," says a Protestant student of Luther, "or despair of
himself led him into the monastery,"#footnote[Scheel, #emph[Martin
Luther];, II, 2nd ed., p. 7.] at the same time emphasizing the
"godliness" in which Luther learned to exercise himself already as a
layman. However, godliness was not the sole driving power which impelled
young Luther. In view of his early religious training it is hardly
possible to dispute that the most pious impulses often influenced him.
Yet, despite his sentiment of despair, he was subject to other factors,
namely, in addition to his natural temperament, the well-founded
premonition that the life of a layman was accompanied by moral dangers
with which he felt himself unable to cope. In his subsequent attacks
upon the monastic vow of chastity, he applies a proverb which says:
"Monks and clerics are mostly the product of despair." In the case of
Luther, "despondency" connotes chiefly a depressing sense of moral
incompetence and the experienced inability to preserve
chastity.#footnote[Erlangen ed., XXI, p. 359. Cf. #emph[ibid.];, X, p.
400, and XIII, p. 130, where he adduces the "proverb": "Despair makes
the monk," applying it to the necessity of gaining a livelihood.]

Another Protestant biographer speaks of the "psychical abnormality" of
Luther in his youth, though, of course, his "especially tender and
impressionable conscience" is again emphasized.#footnote[Böhmer, p. 50.]
A third author exaggerates when he says that the young man’s "nervous
system was unsettled from early youth," and attributes this trouble to
his excessively severe training.#footnote[A, Hausrath, #emph[Luthers
Leben];, Vol. 1, p. 4.] These statements indicate that we are confronted
with a complicated phenomenon. At all events, the existence of a
somewhat disordered constitution, grounded in his very soul, must be
assumed. It was united to the depressing idea of guilt, to which the
ambitious youth appears often to have given free rein. Both together,
the disordered condition of his nerves and the strong sense of guilt,
may possibly explain the fear which, as we shall see, pursued him in a
most terrifying manner in the monastery, and which reappeared ever and
anon throughout his life. During his monastic years, according to his
own statements, he ever sought the aid of a merciful God in his
struggles amid great despair, without being able to discover Him in the
Catholic faith, and most Protestant biographers hold that he was taken
up with this quest even in his student days, until he finally sailed
into the haven of rest upon the discovery of the new Gospel. This
theory, as we shall show later, is not correct. There is no proof
whatever that Luther, prior to the time when he entered the monastery,
had a sense of insufficiency of the Catholic faith and consequently
struggled to find a merciful God. Let us quote here the words of another
Protestant biographer, who, in this instance, judges correctly. Such a
construction, he says, "is neither supported by the facts known to us,
nor has it any probability." "He \[Luther\] does not doubt the
sufficiency of ways and means. All things as yet co-exist 'naively' or
succeed one another in the normal Catholic rotation."#footnote[Scheel,
I, p. 26. Scheel properly excludes from the juvenile period of Luther a
struggle for a merciful God in the sense of most biographers of Luther
and as a motive for his entrance into the monastery (pp. 242 sqq.).
According to him, Luther’s resolution to become a monk was not "the
natural result of a long struggle for God’s mercy" (p. 243). The hastily
composed Latin and German transcript of a sermon delivered by Luther on
February 1, 1534, furnished by Rörer, supplies us with the following
reading: "#emph[Ego fui XV annis monachus et tamem munquam potui
baptismo me comsolari. Ach quando vis semel fromm werden? donec fierem
monachus. Non edebam, non vestiebar, friere, papa, antichristus treib
mich da bin, qui abstulit baptismum];" (Weimar ed., XXXVII, p. 661). In
this entire passage Luther speaks of his monastic period; hence the
words "#emph[donec fierem monachus];" are to be attributed to a
misconception of the copyist, as Scheel observes in his notes (Weimar
ed., XXXVII, p. 519). While it is not permissible to translate these
words by: "as long as I was a monk," especially on account of the
#emph[fierem];, it is probable nevertheless that Luther intended to say
something similar. The German text of the whole passage (Weimar ed.,
XXXVII, p. 661), which appears in the form of a sermon originally
reported by Cruciger, concludes with the following words: "and by such
thoughts I have been driven to embrace monasticism." The text is a
corruption without foundation in fact. Luther apparently had made his
polemical assertion, that he arrived at his new doctrine in consequence
of his struggle for a merciful God, so popular that his followers
unconsciously extended his struggles and doubts to the time prior to his
entrance into the monastery, though he himself does not supply us with
one word to that effect.]

The same author rightly rejects the favorite assumption that the
generality of mankind at that time was agitated by a knowledge or
feeling of the insufficiency of the Catholic way of life and yearned for
better things–which yearning was bound to captivate the frank soul of
young Luther. "It is an erroneous impression to hold that the human
race, prior to the rise of Luther, was moved by a passionate spiritual
commotion and an impatient quest after a more profound religious
philosophy of life."#footnote[Holl, #emph[Luther];, Tübingen, 1923, p.
13.] Many authors endeavored to discover in that age such a highly
significant preparation, a great prelude, as it were, to the
Reformation. Leading authors have discussed "the lively consciousness of
guilt which inspired the people of that age, for the relief of which
many thousands made great exertions," but in vain, until Luther appeared
as the liberator and prophet. Up to his advent "the mighty desire for
certitude in matters of salvation exhausted itself in a gradation and
excess of ecclesiastical performances without obtaining any
repose."#footnote[F. von Bezold, #emph[Gesch. d. deutschen Reformation];,
Berlin, 1890, pp. 248, 242.] This is not the place to present a
characterization of the true ecclesiastical state of affairs. We are at
a point in the development of Luther, when he had had no opportunity to
survey the surrounding world. The student is still traveling his own
road, immersed in his studies and occupied with the affairs of his soul.

While he traveled this road, did the thought of embracing the monastic
state occasionally arise in his mind? Although he himself is reticent
about this matter, we may well believe that this thought did engage his
attention. For it is not likely that when his sudden resolve was forced
from him, the idea of the monastic life entered his mind all at once. It
is to be assumed psychologically that the question of the monastic state
had agitated him for some time, even though he had not made a
decision.#footnote[Thus H. Preuss in #emph[Theol. Literaturblatt]
(Leipsic, 1916), p. 94.] May not the wish to secure the salvation of his
soul by becoming a monk have dawned on him while he was in a melancholy
frame of mind, overwhelmed with a sense of weakness, vacillation and
fear of going completely astray on account of his youthful frivolity?
His assertion that he became a monk out of despair, points to such a
strong impulse. His early religious education, then the active religious
life at Erfurt, the example and activity of the religious Orders at the
latter place, #emph[e.g.];, the Carthusians, whose very strict life he
had observed; furthermore, his intercourse with pious preceptors, such
as Usingen, who eventually became an Augustinian; finally, reminiscences
of Magdeburg, such as that of the princely discalced monk and mendicant:
all these things might have induced him to contemplate the monastic
life.

An event, however, was destined to happen which impelled him to form a
precipitous and premature resolution which was fraught with momentous
consequences.
