== The Hearing at Augsburg. Miltitz
<the-hearing-at-augsburg.-miltitz>
The German Dominicans reported to the Roman curia fresh accusations
against the impetuous Augustinian. A certain rivalry between these two
great and influential bodies may have to some extent prompted this
procedure; but it was not the decisive motive. Older Catholic authors,
relying too confidently on contemporaneous verdicts, have mistakenly
endeavored to trace the origin of the religious schism to the jealousy
that existed between the Dominican and the Augustinian orders, inasmuch
as the former espoused the cause of Tetzel and his indulgence sermons,
whereas the latter rose in defense of Luther and his courageous
utterances. Whatever may have been in the background, as far as the
attitude of Rome was concerned, the documents which were before the
papal curia, namely, the Wittenberg theses, the disputations conducted
there, the Heidelberg theses of Luther, and his "Resolutiones," decided
the issue.

The Pope, acting in conformity with the law, through his fiscal
procurator and the auditor of the camera, cited Luther to Rome, where he
was to present himself within sixty days. At the same time, the
theologian of the sacred palace (#emph[magister sacri palatii];), the
Dominican Sylvester Mazzolini, a native of Prierio (therefore called
Prierias) , was entrusted with the task of preparing an expert opinion.
As he had evidently been exactly informed of the case some time before,
he completed his task within three days. His printed opinion was a
complete apologia for Tetzel and his teaching on indulgences. He
employed unnecessarily bitter expressions against Luther–following a
custom in vogue in those times of controversies against heretics. He
placed special emphasis on the power of the pope and his right of
definitively deciding all ecclesiastical questions, which he set forth
in most forceful terms.#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol. IV, pp. 373 sq.]
When Sylvester’s pamphlet with the citation to Rome reached Luther, he
realized to his consternation, as he tells us, how serious the situation
really was. He made a hasty, all too hasty, decision and published an
indignant response (#emph[Responsio];) to Prierias.#footnote[#emph[Op.
cit.];, Vol. IV, 374 sq.] Relative to the citation, he on the very next
day issued a written appeal for help to the Elector, requesting that
dignitary to insist that the case be tried in Germany. Frederick "the
Wise" was in attendance at the diet of Augsburg at the time.

This diet was also attended by the papal legate, Cardinal Cajetan de
Vio, a highly respected Dominican theologian. The Elector told him that
he would not let his university professor go to Rome. In the meantime
(August 9), the Emperor Maximilian had sent a vigorous letter to the
Pope, assuring him that he would execute the decision of the Holy See
against Luther with all his energy. Luther’s efforts to prevent this
course had proved futile. Assured of imperial support, the curia decided
to accelerate the procedure against the growing evil. It was also
intended to comply with the request of the Elector to have the hearing
conducted in Germany in order to secure the help of this powerful prince
in the war against the Turks. For this reason Cardinal Cajetan received
orders from Rome to summon Luther to appear before him in person to
recant his errors. The order was accompanied by another, to the effect
that Luther, in the event of his refusal to recant, should be
apprehended forthwith and delivered to the Roman authorities. The
Elector and the provincial of the Saxon Augustinians received
simultaneous orders to assist in apprehending Luther in case such a
measure should become necessary. On September 11, the legate received a
further document from Rome, empowering him to conduct the case against
Luther according to his own discretion.

Luther appeared before Cajetan at Augsburg, on October 12. The first
hearing and the subsequent meetings were fruitless. With moderation and
dignity Cajetan demanded the retraction of two theses of Luther’s: one
denying the treasury of merits gained by Christ and the Saints, which
was the foundation of the doctrine of indulgences; the other, contained
in the "Resolutiones," asserting that faith alone renders the Sacraments
of the Church efficacious. He disregarded the other theses because,
although false, they did not so patently offend against theological
truths. As to the treasury of merits, many theologians, among them
Cajetan himself, held that it had already been defined by Pope Clement
VI. In any event, like the independent efficacy of the Sacraments, it
constituted an important doctrine of theology.

Despite all his kindness and determined earnestness, Cardinal Cajetan’s
efforts proved futile. Luther manifested arrogance and offensive
obstinacy. Dismissed with the threat of excommunication, he announced to
the Cardinal that he would appeal from his tribunal "to the Pope, who
would be more correctly informed." To others he said that this was but a
preparation for an appeal to a general council, which was bound to
follow in case the Pope, "in the plenitude of his authority, or rather
tyranny," would reject his appellation. Luther did not tarry for a reply
from the hesitating Cardinal, but secretly fled from the city and
hastened back to Wittenberg.

The Cardinal had also made advances to the Elector, in order to
influence his attitude regarding the election of a German king in
conformity with the intentions of Rome. Frederick subsequently asserted
that he had obtained from Cajetan the promise that Luther would be
returned to Germany in any event. It is certain that the scholarly and
gentle prince of the Church was no match for the cunning diplomacy of
the Elector.

The formerly popular legend of Cajetan’s haughty treatment of Luther is
now admitted to be unhistorical even by Protestant writers. The Cardinal
is described as "humble, just, and self-sacrificing" and his conduct
towards Luther as dignified; he is admitted to have been "an earnest
and, in his judgment concerning the abuses prevalent at the curia, a
strict and free-spoken thinker."#footnote[Paul Kalkoff, #emph[Luther und
die Entscheidungsjahre];, pp. 57, 157; #smallcaps[Idem] in
#emph[Kirchengesch];. #emph[Forschungen, E. Brieger dargebracht];, 1912,
and in the #emph[Theol. Studien und Kritiken];, 1917, p. 246. Similarly
Hermelink in the #emph[Theol. Rundschau];, 1917, p. 141] Luther, on the
contrary, accuses him of being "most wofully ignorant" and of having
treated him like a lion.#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, I, p. 282.]

The question which now tormented Luther was whether he would be safe at
Wittenberg. He thought of going to Paris, where the theological faculty
of the University was engaged in a quarrel with Rome. But his friend
Spalatin, a preacher at the court of the Elector Frederick, provided
protection through that ruler. Luther entered into a lively
correspondence with Spalatin, through whom he assured the prince that he
would gladly go into exile rather than embarrass him through the fury of
his enemies. In the interim, on November 28, he appeared before a notary
and two witnesses, and drew up a solemn appeal to a general council. In
the lengthy formula he declared his intention to do or say naught
against the Roman Church, the teacher and head of all the churches, nor
against the authority of the Pope–as long as the latter were well
advised (bene consultus). The affidavit was signed, as the subscription
of the notary attests, "in the chapel of Corpus Christi, situated in the
cemetery of the parish church." The little church was a pretty structure
erected in honor of "Christ’s holy body," such as adorned many a
churchyard in those days.

Luther’s appeal to an ecumenical council, like his former appeal, was
inadmissible and ineffective. According to canon law, an appeal to a
council was a penal offense. This provision was justified by the answer
to the question: Has any individual who wishes to create a schism within
the Church the right to convoke all the bishops of the world to a
council, prior to his submission?

On December 18, the Elector addressed a letter to Cardinal Cajetan, in
which he disclosed to the latter the line of action he had resolved upon
with reference to his protégé, and to which he always adhered. Luther’s
doctrine, he said, had not as yet been proven heretical; Luther was
prepared to appear before a university for a disputation and formal
examination; hence, nothing could be done to him at Wittenberg. But Rome
proceeded directly, though, out of regard for the Elector and his
participation in the great questions of ecclesiastical policy which were
then pending, it proceeded with notable slowness. At first an attempt
was made to influence Frederick by sending him the Golden Rose blessed
by the Pope. It was customary to send it annually to a prince as a mark
of distinction. The presentation was to have been made by the Roman
notary and titular chamberlain, Karl von Miltitz. The selection of this
Saxon nobleman was not a happy one. Miltitz undertook his commission
with great pomp, but in the end executed it in a very ineffective
manner. He was an incompetent man and a seeker of benefices.

In order to persuade Frederick to deliver up Luther, Miltitz, of his own
accord, adopted wrong methods. In the Dominican monastery at Leipsic he
overwhelmed Tetzel with unmerited and bitter reproaches, which are said
to have hastened his death. Luther consented to make a doubtful promise
to the importunate agent, who exceeded his commission, namely, to
observe silence if his opponents did the same. There could be no
question of a general silence on the Catholic side in view of the ever
increasing dangers that threatened the Church; and, on the other hand,
Luther was far from expecting his opponents to observe silence, or from
being silent himself. Under the influence of Miltitz, Luther at that
time published a curious work under the title of "#emph[Unterricht];"
(Instructions), etc., which contained both affirmations and negations,
in order to conciliate his opponents.

Miltitz sent boastful reports of the success of his efforts to the Roma
curia, and they were not entirely devoid of effect. The death of Emperor
Maximilian, on January 12, 1519, and the fact that Frederick of Saxony
had some prospects of becoming emperor, supplied Leo X with a reason for
new delays. Finally the Pope, in a friendly brief (#emph[Paterno
affectu];), issued March 29, 1519, summoned Luther to Rome to receive
personal instructions and abandon his erroneous doctrines. It cannot be
proved that the treatment accorded Luther was severe and ill-considered.
When the brief arrived, steps had already been taken by Luther for the
Leipsic disputation, which destroyed every hope of arriving at an
understanding. At Rome this measure occasioned the termination of the
trial which had already been too long drawn out. Luther’s pen was not
exclusively devoted to attacks. With impetuous activity he had in the
meanwhile composed a series of tracts which, beside those mentioned
above, were dedicated in part to a glorification of his cause, and in
part written to pastoral requirements. His popular religious writings
were intended to invest him with the indispensable reputation of a man
who was solicitous solely about the welfare of souls. This activity
gained for him a large following among religious-minded people. Among
other things he published, in that period of stress, a serviceable
explanation of the Our Father, a short instruction on confession, a
condensed explanation of the Decalogue, and an interpretation of Psalm
109 (Vulg. 110). Even before this he had entered the field of popular
literature with an exposition of the seven penitential Psalms, a sermon
on the Ten Commandments, and some other smaller writings.

His history of the Augsburg trial (#emph[Acfa Augustana];), on the other
hand, as well as his edition of the "Replica" of Sylvester Prierias
against his "Responses," were polemical. By publishing a reprint of the
"Replica" of the Master of the Sacred Palace, he intended to represent
Prierias as a man entirely devoid of importance and worthy of
disdain.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. IV, p. 375.]
