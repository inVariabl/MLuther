== Abnormal Psychological Traits
<abnormal-psychological-traits>
The first of the abnormal traits of Luther’s psychology was his fear of
the devil.

Numerous facts and utterances hitherto quoted attest how consciously and
persistently he moved in the imaginary sphere of the power of darkness.

Fearfully he ever beholds this power about him. As he progresses in age,
the whole world becomes more and more the "kingdom of the devil," as he
styles it in 1544. The devil governs it and devastates it by his tools,
"the Turk, the Jew, the pope"; but, he maintains, "he shall be under
Christ to all eternity."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, V, 275.]

Before Luther’s time popular belief in the devil had assumed an
exaggerated form. It had become firmly established, especially among the
mining folk, from whom Luther descended, in consequence of the uncanny
labors which they performed within the bowels of the earth. Even learned
men were infected by this superstition. Had the sober doctrine of Holy
Writ and the Church been adhered to, the faithful would have been
preserved from many aberrations in this sphere. Luther magnified and
coarsened the maniacal ideas which his parental home and the tendency of
his age had implanted in his mind. He confirmed this belief among the
Germans, whereas, had he wished to be a true reformer of ecclesiastical
life, he would have found a very useful field for his activity in
correcting them and the other moral diseases of his age. Up to his time,
however, no one had delineated the devil and his works with so much
detail, no one had addressed the people on the subject with such a
weight of personality and such urgent and apparently religious
instructions as Luther.

In his Large Catechism, where he speaks of the damage wrought by the
devil, he tells how Satan "breaks many a man’s neck, drives others out
of their mind or drowns them in the water"; how he "stirs up strife and
brings murder, sedition, and war; also causes hail and tempests,
destroying the corn and the cattle, and poisoning the air,"
etc.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 278. The following citations
#emph[ibid.];, pp. 279, 281, 284.] In a similar vein he writes in his
Home-Postil and in his Church-Postil, where he attributes to Satan every
evil with which mankind is afflicted. His own experiences are frequently
reflected in his excited ebullitions, especially when he touches upon
the demoniac fury with which his faith had been assailed. In connection
with the latter he asserts that the devil is more at home in Holy
Scripture than all the universities and scholars. "Whosoever attempts to
dispute with him," he says, "will assuredly be pitched on the ash heap."
He is convinced that madness is in every case due to the devil, who
always employs mad men as his instruments. How many people, he says, has
the devil seized bodily, especially when they had caused him trouble in
virtue of a pact! According to his own confession, Luther often was
frightened by demons. There are less of them at large now because they
have entered into his enemies, the heretics, Anabaptists, and fanatics.
Luther has the faculty of furnishing a fertile account of the various
species of devils, their habitations, and the forms which they assume.

He is most prolix, however, in his statements and reflections on the
demons’ attitude toward himself. It is he whom the evil powers have
selected to make war upon, because of his great mission. This mania
throws him into a state of misery and mental darkness and he imagines
"nightly encounters" in which he is compelled to contend with the enemy
of the Gospel; hence, all the supposed obstacles to the rapid
propagation of his religion among the papists; hence, all those
remarkable phantoms which hold his mind in their powerful spell.

When, towards the end of his life, in 1546, he was compelled to journey
to Eisleben, he writes that an assembly of devils congregated in that
town in order to prevent the establishment of peace which he
contemplated.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 297.] Indeed, he believed that
he actually saw the devil, even more plainly than at the time he
sojourned in the castle of Coburg.#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol. VI,
p. 130.] Thus, one evening, as he stood praying at the window of his
domicile, he saw the devil perched on a nearby street fountain, jeering
at him, thus insinuating that he was his sworn enemy. He hastened to his
friend, Michael Coelius, the court preacher of Mansfeld, who lived in
the house, and amid tears apprised him of what he had seen. Coelius
narrates the incident in his funeral oration on Luther. His physician,
Ratzeberger, adds that Luther informed Coelius and Jonas that the devil
had showed him his posterior and told him that he would achieve nothing
in Eisleben.

The whole affair, naturally, was purely a hallucination. It is
reminiscent of the hallucinations which Luther had at other times, for
example, at the Wartburg and the Coburg, as a result of his excited
mental condition.

Once, at Wittenberg, he descried the devil in the garden beneath his
window in the shape of a huge wild boar, which disappeared when he
boldly jeered at it.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp. 131 sq.] On the other
hand, the disputation with the devil on the Mass, as was shown above,
was but a fiction of his pen. It may be questioned whether the frequent
nightly attacks launched by Satan always occurred without
hallucinations. According to his own statement, a vulgar "#emph[Leck
mich …];" often banished them. He seriously states in his Home-Postil:
"The devil is always about us in disguise, as I myself have witnessed,
taking, #emph[e.g.];, the form of a hog, of a burning wisp of straw, and
such like."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, VI, 132.]

Luther was also much annoyed by witches, whom he calls "harlots of the
devil." "I wanted to burn them myself," he says, "according to the usage
of the law, where the priests commenced to stone the guilty
ones."#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., Vol. IV, n. 3979.] On
another occasion he declares against the female corrupters of milk, that
"the method of Doctor Pommer is the best"– a reminiscence of the
latter’s treatment of the butter-vat. Luther’s declarations against
witches, as contained in his #emph[Table Talks];, became universally
known and together with his writings, which are replete with demoniac
thoughts, fatefully contributed to the bloody persecution of
witches.#footnote[N. Paulus, #emph[Hexenwahn und Hexenprozess,
vornebmlich im 16. Jahrbundert] (1910), pp. 488 sqq.]

Luther was very much inclined to assume that persons subject to violent
attacks of hysteria were possessed by the devil. However, he did not
wish to resort to the customary ecclesiastical exorcism with its
commands addressed to the devil, but restricted himself to prayer. "God
knows the time when the devil must depart." The success of prayer,
however, usually appeared rather dubious.

In January, 1546, he experienced a peculiar encounter with the supposed
devil in the sacristy of the parish church of Wittenberg. In the
presence of several doctors, ecclesiastics, and students, the devil was
to be driven out of a girl of eighteen, a native of Ossitz, near
Meissen, by the prayers of Luther and his attendants. It is evident from
the accounts of two participants that the girl was in a highly
hysterical condition. These two witnesses are Frederick Staphylus, a
future convert to Catholicism, and Sebastian Froschel, Luther’s deacon.
When, after the recitation of a somewhat lengthy prayer, Luther noticed
no sign of the devil’s departure, he applied his foot to the patient to
signify his disdain for the devil. The poor creature whom he had thus
insulted, followed him with threatening looks and gestures. The door
could not be opened, as it had been bolted, and the key mislaid. Since
the window, which was bolted with iron bars, did not permit of escape,
Luther, the devil’s greatest and best-hated foe on earth, says
Staphylus, "ran about hither and thither, seized with fright,"
constantly pursued by the infuriated girl, and writhed and deported
himself like a person in despair. Finally the sacristan passed in a
hatchet, with which Staphylus burst open the door, and thus liberated
Luther from his desperate plight. The pious Froschel says that
afterwards reports came to Wittenberg to the effect that the evil spirit
no longer tormented the girl, as formerly.#footnote[Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, Vol. VI, pp. 137 sq.]

Luther’s expectation of the end of the world is another dark trait which
pervades his life and assumes a more vivid hue in his later years. He
makes various estimates as to when the end may be
expected.#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol. V, pp. 242, 248.]

On one occasion he says it will come in fifty years. Then again he
predicts that the catastrophe will have happened by 1548. "We shall yet
experience the fulfillment of the Scriptures." The idea circulated
widely. His eccentric pupil and friend, Michael Stiefel, despite
Luther’s opposition, anticipated the date by assigning the year 1533,
the eighteenth of October, at exactly eight o’clock in the morning, as
the date of the world’s end. At this hour he assembled his trembling
parishioners in church, and, as nothing happened, was severely censured
by Luther.

The end of the world was frequently predicted by other, even by great,
men. In Luther’s case, however, the expectation is accompanied by
unusual agitation and morbid symptoms. It springs from the idea of his
vocation and success. He revealed Antichrist in the papacy, and this
revelation, according to the Bible, was to be followed immediately by
the advent of the Great Judge. This theory he sets forth in detail and
with the greatest seriousness in his tract against Catharinus, appealing
to the celebrated passage of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Thessalonians and
the misunderstood prophecy of Daniel.

There is something visionary about his proclamations concerning the end
of the world, and for this reason they deserve closer
consideration.#footnote[For proofs of the following #emph[ibid.];, pp.
242 sqq. Gf. the passages #emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., index to Vol.
VI, 5. v. "Tag, jüngster."]

Many signs in nature, human society, and the empire of Satan, he held,
announced the end of the world, as did also the ever increasing
brutalization of the masses and the upper classes. In his fantastic
interpretation of the monk-calf, he adduces the horrors of the papacy in
corroboration of his prophecy. In old age he says of himself: "Let the
Lord call me hence, I have committed, seen, and suffered sufficient of
evil." At that time he was able to find even a certain consolation in
reflecting on the end of the world, and to speak of the "dear Judgment
Day," which was to liberate him from the difficulties which surrounded
his work, and from the struggles within his own soul. The great
successes which he finally experiences, appear to him to signify the
last flaring up of the light. "The light is approaching extinction; it
still makes a mighty effort, but thereafter it will be extinguished in a
twinkle." Oppressive dreams of the impending judgment visit him. He
overcomes the impression by hoping vigorously and longing for his
departure from this vale of tears. Thus a mixture of dread and
consolation, of fear and satisfaction is prevalent in his expectation of
the end of the world.

So sure is he in his calculations that, in view of the brevity of time
still allotted, he does not concern himself particularly about the
discipline of the Church in the future, #emph[e.g.];, about the
institution and order of public worship.#footnote[Cfr. Köstlin-Kawerau,
#emph[M. Luther];, Vol. II, p. 522.]

The spiritual exhaustion which overwhelmed him towards the end of his
life had a share in this indifference. It also belongs to the dark side
of his spiritual life. Luther exclaims in his apathy: "Let everything
collapse, stand, perish, as it may. Let matters take their course as
they are, since, after all, matters will not change …Germany has had its
day and will never again be what it once was." Thus he writes in
1542.#footnote[In a letter to the preacher Probst at Bremen, on March
26, 1542. #emph[Briefwechsel];, XIV, p. 218; Grisar, #emph[Luther];,
Vol. V, p. 226; the following passages, #emph[ibid.];, pp. 230 sq., 246
sqq.] He is "tired of this life," he writes in the same year; "all
thoughts concerning plans and rendering aid begone from me! All is
vanity." And again in 1543: "We will let things take their course as
they may." He regards his words: "Let happen what may" as inspired by
Christ, who will seize the reins Himself. The ailments, too, which he
suffered, contributed to this despondency. He was afflicted alternately
by oppression of the heart and by violent and whirling sensations in the
head, accompanied by a ringing in the ears, and by sufferings caused by
gallstone and other maladies.

"Distemper, melancholy, and severe afflictions," says Ratzeberger,
oppressed him. This physician believes that the mental sufferings which
Luther sustained contributed to his death.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[op.
cit.];] Luther is profoundly grieved at his inability "to proceed
effectively" against the papists, "so great is the immensity of the
papistic monster."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, IV, 344.]

He sees the advent of the Tridentine Council and he execrates and curses
it.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];]

With avidity he gives credence to the fable that the Emperor and the
Pope had dispatched ambassadors to the Grand Turk with gifts and an
offer of peace, ready to prostrate themselves before the infidel ruler
in long Turkish garments. He says that this is "a token of the coming of
the end of all things."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];]

Indeed, in the disturbed state of his mind he believed the most
incredible things. He felt that he was repeatedly saved from the danger
of being poisoned by the papists, who pursued him with deadly intent. He
preached in poisoned pulpits without injury to himself. Witches
endeavored in vain to destroy him and his family. Hired incendiaries
convulsed the districts which adhered to him; but the devil raved in
vain.

Dissatisfaction with Wittenberg finally induced him to abandon that city
forever. Although he had bidden adieu to his Wittenberg hearers on a
former occasion, and although he wanted to depart from the ungrateful
city in the beginning of 1544, he did not carry out his plan until the
end of July, 1545. After careful preparation#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp.
341 sqq.] he betakes himself to Zeitz, whence he addresses a letter to
his wife, declaring that he will never come back and requesting her to
return to the estate of her family at Zulsdorf and to restore the Black
Monastery to the Elector. He says he is resolved to beg for his bread in
his old age. From Zeitz he repairs to Merseburg, where, on August 2, he
confers upon the canon of the cathedral chapter, George von Anhalt, a
so-called ordination as bishop of the diocese that had been abolished by
Duke August of Saxony. From Merseburg he proceeds to Leipsic, where he
preaches on the twelfth of August. He was prevailed upon to return to
Wittenberg only after most strenuous efforts put forth by Melanchthon
and Bugenhagen, who had been appointed emissaries of the city, the
University, and the Elector.

After his return he felt better for a while. Owing to the devotion shown
him by his followers, his mental depression yielded to a lively spirit
of enterprise. It was a sudden transition, such as not infrequently
occurred in his interior life, an idiosyncrasy of psychopathic
sufferers.#footnote[John Joseph Mangan, in #emph[Life, Character, and
Influence of Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam] (1927), at pp. 87–88 of
volume two, makes the following observations on Luther, which confirm
Father Grisar’s position. He says: "As our study of Erasmus has led us
to decide definitely that he was a neurasthenic, so our study of Luther
has convinced us that he was a psychopath, if not always, then most
assuredly at intervals."– The author advances a number of proofs in
substantiation of his assertion, very interesting, as some of them are
based upon medical observations. (Tr.)] The enemies were made to sense
the old Luther in the new polemical literature which he produced. But
melancholia once more returned, though apparently not accompanied by his
former temptations.

Because of his suspicion of the teaching of others, association with him
is described as intolerable, since he always suspected deviations from
his own doctrinal position and would brook no differences of opinion.
Melanchthon, who held different opinions on various points, #emph[e.g.];,
on the Eucharist, complained bitterly and wrote afterwards that he was
forced to put up with "an ignominious servility" in his association with
Luther. He compares himself with the unfortunate Prometheus chained to
the rock and describes Luther as the demagogue Cleon and the impetuous
Hercules.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. V, pp. 252 sqq.] Forced
to linger, as it were, in the cave of Cyclops, and not feeling secure
against the secret wrath of Luther, he also desired to leave Wittenberg
and announced his readiness "to slink away"–such is his
expression.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, VI, 347.]

One particularly prominent trait in the spiritual life of Luther is his
extraordinary capacity for self-delusion. The inward necessity of
continually justifying anew to the world, and no less to himself, his
pretended calling, the overwhelming ambition of belittling his
antagonists and augmenting the number of his own followers and, finally,
his inevitable and constant perplexities, resulted in most curious
expressions of self-delusion, which sometimes contradicted the views he
entertained at other times.

Thus the moral corruption developing under the new evangel on occasion
would appear terrible to him only because the gospel which he preached
was pure and holy, and light intensifies the shadows. As there is no
light in the papacy, he contends, its horrible evils and vices are not
so noticeable. He ascribes the corruption of his followers to the devil,
who would discredit the evangel, but on other occasions admits that it
was caused by his #emph[sola fides] doctrine which implied the
inefficacy of good works.#footnote[Cfr. Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. IV,
pp. 210 sqq.; Vol. VI, pp. 331 sq.]

A few examples will show how arbitrarily his mental processes
contravened the ordinary laws of experience and the rules of logic, in
order to conform with the idea of his vocation, which dominated him with
morbid force.

God continuously performs miracles in confirmation of his doctrine. In
response to the prayers of the Lutherans, He destroys the enemies of His
teaching. "By my prayers I have brought about the death of Duke George
of Saxony; by means of our prayers we intend to encompass also the death
of others." With the greatest apparent naiveté he finds his doctrines
confirmed by the ancient doctors of the Church, such as St. Augustine,
whereas in matter of fact they state the exact contrary. He cannot
comprehend why the whole world does not agree with him and says that
malice alone prevents the papists from accepting what is so evidently
right; or, rather, they accept it in secret, as the pope and the Roman
curia do, but they do not wish to honor him and the truth. The most
horrible infidelity is rampant under the papacy. The papists do not heed
"that God incessantly attacks them with many wounds, plagues, and
signs." Has He not confirmed the Lutheran religion by the sudden death
of Zwingli?

I am in duty bound to proclaim to the world what I "feel inwardly
through the spirit of God." Indeed, I permit myself to be guided by God
"as the wind and the waves propel the ship." Opposition and the din of
battle are but the seal of divine approbation on my work. In the
Peasants’ War he boldly asserted that God commanded him to proclaim that
the peasants were to be slain like dogs. In a spirit of defiance he
afterwards vouches, with regard to his whole doctrinal system, that he
will abide "by the first mandate of the vocation received from on high,"
by the "firstfruits of the received spirit," even "if God or Christ
should announce the contrary" (!) He may not yield, since, in his own
imagination, his victory over the papacy is already assured. "This
majesty has fallen," "it has been destroyed" by the "spirit of the mouth
of the Lord." "The Church will be without a pope," since he will fall
just as the Turk. "Even now he is singing Eli, Eli," because he has been
struck. Soon men will say, Expiravit–“he has breathed his last.” "My
adversaries will have neither the Word nor the Cross." They all avoid
the Cross.

"Here I, a poor monk, and a poor nun must come to the rescue. We two
comprehend the article of the Cross and raise it up; for this reason the
Word and the Cross are sufficient; they give us assurance."

Thus the series of illusions outlined above is concluded with the
remarkable tableau showing how Luther and his Kate raise up the the
Cross in the sight of the world–they who had bound themselves by a
solemn vow before the altar of God to embrace His Cross in a life of
voluntary chastity, poverty, and obedience. How different the reality!
To what extent the Cross disappears in Luther’s conception of the
married state and sexual life will be seen in a subsequent section.
