== "The Bold, Lusty Lie"
<the-bold-lusty-lie>
This subject demands a special note. It was part of Luther’s theological
system. Strange as this statement may sound, yet his attitude towards
lying is based upon principles which he formally defended.#footnote[For
the following cf. Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. IV, pp. 80–178.] He
taught, and endeavored to demonstrate on diverse occasions, that lying
is permitted as a matter of expediency or of necessity, provided that it
redounds to the advantage of the new Evangel or to the real benefit of
others. He excludes only the lie that works an injury. He proposed this
theology of lying as early as 1524. Points of contact with the past were
not entirely wanting, notwithstanding the contrary teaching of St.
Augustine on the unlawfulness of lying in every form. But never before
was the lawfulness of lying brought into a system.

By degrees, Luther reduces the lie of convenience or necessity to a
virtue. "Lying is a virtue," he says, "if it is indulged in for the
purpose of preventing the fury of the devil, or made to serve the honor,
the life, and the welfare of one’s fellowmen." He likewise regarded it
as permissible if intended to secure a personal advantage pleasing to
God or, in general, to promote His glory.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp.
108 sqq., 116 sqq., 131 sqq.] In confirmation of his attitude he
repeatedly appeals to misconstrued examples from the Old Testament.

In the long war which he waged upon the Catholic Church, and which he
believed to be for the glory of God, he so habituated himself to the
application of his fundamental principle, #emph[viz.];, that everything
was permissible in the warfare against Antichrist, as to feel no
reluctance in resorting to notorious falsehoods. Indeed, it is probable
that, owing to his peculiar practice of auto-suggestion, he finally
believed his unfair and offensive inventions, in consequence of his
frequent repetition of them, especially since they offered him an
apparent composure in his qualms of conscience. The author has collected
a veritable arsenal of untrue assertions made by Luther, especially
against the "papists," in his larger work on Luther, in which he has
also offered a psychological explanation of the strange phenomenon of
Luther’s mendacity and tried to give an insight into the infectious
results of his lying.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol. IV, pp. 80 sqq.]
