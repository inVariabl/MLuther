== Free Christianity and the Freedom of the Will
<free-christianity-and-the-freedom-of-the-will>
When, in the period from 1520 to about 1525, Luther approached his
doctrine of so-called free Christianity without binding
dogmas,#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol. III, pp. 9 sqq.; V, 432 sqq.] he
nevertheless revealed glimpses of an intention of adhering to the norms
of the Christian religion. He speaks with vigor about truths undeniably
based upon tradition and guaranteed by the Bible. In brief, he desired
to be a true Christian. But the inexorable logic of his subjectivistic
system produced a different result. It compelled him with the force of
gravity, as it were, to abandon his positive foundation, notwithstanding
his refusal to admit it to himself, since he does not follow out his
conclusions to the end, but turns back after having gone halfway. It is
impossible to form any other opinion of his expectorations, so often
influenced by passion and saturated with rhetoric. Not infrequently they
contain appeals to liberty which are irreconcilable with true
Christianity. Evidently this phenomenon is associated with the
impetuosity which animated him at the outset of his career. Under
unfavorable circumstances he was not capable of moderating his
temperament. In the stress of his labors he did not weigh his words.
Inclined to doubt and criticism, his great success on the stage of the
world swept him on to further doubt and criticism.

Only when the fanatical sects’ increased in strength, did a reaction set
in, which caused him to favor a more positive attitude. In his attacks
upon them, his fear of a free Christianity gained the upper hand,
prudence asserted her claims, and there came a time when Luther reversed
his views and corrected his utterances. Instead of making internal
experience and spiritual relish the sole criterion, he now emphasized
(especially after 1525) the so-called external Word of God and the
authority of the Bible, in so far as they seemed to him clear and
indisputable. He placed the rule of faith in the foreground and conceded
greater importance to good works. The sight of the general decadence and
the dissolving effects of his sermons on Christian freedom in opposition
to the law, compelled him more and more to desist from his attacks on
the motive of fear of punishment in the fulfillment of the commandments.
When, finally, the Peasants’ Revolt began to shake the foundations of
the social and moral order, his return to positive religion became more
pronounced, or, as has been said, he turned from the free Evangel to the
legal structure of a Protestantism under state control.

Nevertheless, his early utterances on freedom and intellectual liberty
are re-echoed in his later ones. The primitive fallacy of his system
could not be eradicated. It took only certain impacts to strike his
excitable mentality and cause him once more to espouse the cause of
unrestricted liberty.

In the period of his early activity, #emph[i.e.];, before 1525, while
Luther was engaged in his struggle with the papacy and, in part, with
himself, he expressed himself as follows concerning the rights of
subjectivism:

"Neither the pope nor the bishop nor any other man has the right to
dictate even so much as a syllable to a Christian believer, except with
the latter’s consent." Formerly, under the papacy, we had "no right to
form an opinion," but now "all councils have been overthrown." No one,
he says, may "command what men must believe." "If I am to know what is
false doctrine, I have the right to judge." Let others arrive at
whatever decision they please, "I also have the right to judge, whether
I will accept it or not …You yourself must be able to say, this is
right, that is wrong …God must tell you deep down in your heart: this is
the Word of God." Autonomy, according to him, is to be maintained at all
times,#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol. IV, pp. 482 sqq.] even towards the
sermons which every member of the congregation may criticize, reject or
accept.#footnote[#emph[Supra];, No. 4 of this chapter.] In fact, private
judgment is to be exercised even in relation to himself (so he says
incidentally); for "no one is bound to believe me, let each one look to
himself. To warn all I am able, but stop any man I can
not."#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. III, p. 392.] "If we all are
priests, how then shall we not have the right to discriminate and judge
what is right or wrong in faith?" "A lowly man may have the right
opinion; why, then, should it not be followed?" The Bible may be
interpreted by everyone, even by a "humble miller’s maid, nay, by a
child of nine if it has the faith."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol. II, p.
31; Vol. IV, p. 389.]

He intoned hymns of liberty relative to the commandments, particularly
in his work on "The Freedom of a Christian," and thus brought about dire
results because of the confusion they created. Once you have
comprehended the Word by faith, he expressly says, "all commandments are
fulfilled and you shall be free in all things." "No one can be
forced."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol. III, p. 11; Vol. IV, pp. 487 sq.]

Is the reception of the Sacraments also a free matter? In 1521 Luther
declared: "Every individual ought to be free with regard to the
reception of the Sacraments. If anyone does not wish to be baptized, let
him please himself about it. If anyone does not wish to receive holy
communion, that is his precious right. Also, if anyone does not wish to
confess, that is his right before God."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol.
III, pp. 9 sqq.] He had already disposed of confession as a Sacrament.
With respect to Baptism and Communion, however, he subsequently defends
the necessity of receiving them. In 1521 he writes in another work: "I
approve of faith and Baptism, but no one should be compelled; everyone
ought to be exhorted and to exercise liberty in these matters." Perhaps
his confused declarations relative to Baptism and Communion are intended
to exclude only physical coercion, whilst at the same time he completely
spurns confession as such. Yet, according to his whole system (as many
modern Protestant theologians admit), Baptism would not be necessary
because "salvation is possible without Baptism"; since "the salvation
dispensed in the Sacrament is none other than that obtained through the
instrumentality of the Word of the sermon" (Erich Haupt). The same is to
be affirmed of the Lord’s Supper. Consequently, according to Luther,
Christ instituted Sacraments the use of which depends upon the good
pleasure of men.

Such expressions–which could be multiplied considerably–lead us to the
very brink of religious radicalism. In the heat of the combat against
the dogmatic teachings of the papacy, during which, it is true, he did
not always weigh his words, Luther proclaimed complete anarchy. Modern
liberal Protestantism loves this kind of so-called liberty. Harnack
styles it a "rich spring-tide" in the history of Luther’s development,
though, unfortunately, it was not followed by a "full-blown summer …In
those years," he says, "Luther was elevated above himself and apparently
overcame the limitations of his own individuality." In contrast with the
demand of numerous contemporary Protestant theologians, who plead for a
return to Luther as he appeared in the spring of life, when, as they
allege, he was truly liberal-minded, we may quote this remarkable
statement by Frederick Paulsen, the famous Protestant philosopher and
historian: "The principle …to allow no authority on earth to prescribe
the faith is anarchical. And on these lines there can be no church with
the right of examining candidates for the ministry and holding
visitations of the clergy, as Luther did." This author furthermore says
that "Luther as pope," which he really wanted to be, glaringly
contradicts that principle. "Whoever stands in need of a pope, had
better be advised to stick to the real one at Rome." Fundamentally,
Paulsen asserts, "an antinomy lies at the very root of the Protestant
Church," namely: "There can be no earthly authority in matters of faith,
and: There must be such an authority."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol. IV,
p. 485.]

The religion which Luther cultivated in spite of his urge for liberty
was the #emph[religion of the enslaved will];. He ascribed so much
influence to the omnipotence of God and to what he calls grace, that
man’s liberty to perform moral and meritorious acts was completely
shattered. Now free-will was constantly and rightly regarded as the
preliminary condition of divine worship. "God created thee without thy
aid," says St. Augustine, "but He does not desire to justify thee
without thy cooperation." Luther, however, treats man like a block of
wood in matters pertaining to salvation. As he expresses it, man is
ridden like a beast by God or by the devil.

Erasmus in 1523 decided to publish an attack on Luther’s denial of the
doctrine of free-will.#footnote[Cfr. Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. II,
pp. 223 sqq.] As a humanist he was particularly interested in defending
the freedom of the will. On the other hand, Luther’s obstinate negation
of free-will was one of the most vulnerable spots in his doctrinal
armor, against which an attack could be most easily launched with the
prospect of winning widespread applause. It had not been an easy matter
to persuade Erasmus to take this resolution. For he had long favored
Luther at least to the extent of warmly approving his campaign not only
against the existing abuses, but also against certain perfectly
justifiable religious usages and necessary ecclesiastical institutions,
which he himself was also wont to criticize. After Luther’s open rupture
with the Church (1520) the cautious Erasmus became more and more guarded
in his utterances relative to the religious
innovation.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, Vol. II, pp. 249 sq.] Amid his
epistolary compliments to Luther one may read his assurance, that he
would never separate himself from the divinely instituted spiritual
authority of the Church; that he did not wish to bother about the clash
provoked by the religious controversy, but desired to pursue his studies
unperturbed; and that God had sent the strong medicine which Luther
administered in order to purge His Church, since Christ had been
well-nigh forgotten. It required remonstrations on the part of men in
high authority, even in Rome, of the King of England and of the Emperor,
to determine Erasmus to take up his pen against Luther.

In the spring of 1524 Luther heard that his erstwhile patron was engaged
in composing a book against him. He correctly appraised the influence
which Erasmus would exert upon the numerous humanistic parties which had
formerly favored him, but had become estranged from his cause as a
result of his violent activities. The voice of their highly revered
leader was bound to turn the scales against him. Hence, in April, he
wrote a strange letter to Erasmus, then at Basle. He said that he had
nothing to fear from an attack, but, after flattering his antagonist for
his rare qualities and merits, begs him: "Do not write against me, or
increase the number and strength of my opponents; particularly do not
attack me through the press, and I, for my part, shall also refrain from
attacking you." "With patience and respect," he continues, he had
observed that Erasmus, alas, did not possess grace from above to
comprehend the new Evangel.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 260.]

Erasmus’s treatise appeared at Basle in 1524; it was written in
excellent Latin and bore the title: "#emph[De Libero Arbitrio Diatribe];"
(Discourse on Free-Will). The author triumphantly refutes the heresy of
the enslaved will, and despite his great and often timid reserve, his
critical rejection of the Biblical supports of Luther’s theory is quite
as brilliant as his use of the sacred text in defense of the Catholic
doctrine.

According to Luther, he says, not only goodness, but also moral evil
must be referred to God, which, however, conflicts with God’s nature and
is excluded by His holiness. Luther maintains that God punishes sinners
who cannot be held accountable for their misdeeds. Hence, so far as this
earthly life is concerned, laws and penalties are superfluous, because
there can be no responsibility without freedom of choice.

"In defending free-will," thus writes the Protestant theologian A.
Taube, "Erasmus fights for responsibility, duty, guilt, and
repentance–ideas which are essential to Christian piety." “He vindicates
the moral character of the Christian religion …”#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];,
p. 263.]

It was not to be expected that Erasmus, who was a stranger to
Scholasticism, would enter upon a technical discussion of his topic. Nor
was it exactly necessary, although many points might have been made more
telling, as, for instance, the refutation of Luther’s doctrine of
absolute predestination. The Catholics were highly elated at the
"Diatribe" of Erasmus. Duke George of Saxony thanked him in a letter,
but, in his frank and honest way, did not suppress the caustic remark:
"Had you come to your present decision three years ago, and withstood
Luther’s shameful heresies in writing, instead of merely opposing him
secretly, as though you were not willing to do him much harm, the flames
would not have extended so far."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp. 261 sq.]
The "Diatribe" also met with the approval of close friends of Luther.
Wolfgang Capito had previously declared his opposition to Luther’s
theory of the enslaved will. Peter Mosellanus (Schade) of Leipsic had
spoken so strongly against Luther’s theses and his teaching on
predestination that warning reports were sent to Wittenberg. George
Agricola, the learned naturalist, who at first admired Luther, was
repelled by his denial of free-will.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 242.]
Melanchthon, to whom, despite his former approval, this denial became
painful in the course of time, thanked his friend Erasmus for the
moderation which he had observed. He became more and more convinced that
Erasmus was right in certain cardinal theological points, and himself
became an opponent of determinism.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp. 261 sq.]
