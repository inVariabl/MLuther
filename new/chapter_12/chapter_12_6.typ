== Luther and Zwingli in the Castle of Marburg
<luther-and-zwingli-in-the-castle-of-marburg>
On April 22, 1529, the Landgrave of Hesse proposed to his friend Zwingli
that he and Luther, as well as the principal representatives of the two
parties in the controversy concerning the Eucharist, hold a theological
disputation. It was not zeal for religion which induced him to suggest
this conference, but the desire of realizing his political ambitions,
which, in comformity with Zwingli, were directed against the Emperor and
the house of Hapsburg. The exiled Duke Ulric of Württemberg had won over
the Landgrave to this hopeless idea of a conference. The intrepid
Zwingli favored it at once, without, however, holding out any hope of
union on his part. When the matter was broached to Luther, he at first
expressed himself against it. Melanchthon also had his scruples. The
Elector John at that time was not disposed to have anything to do with
the Sacramentarians, as he feared the designs of the Swiss. Eventually,
however, the urgent invitations of the Landgrave were crowned with
success. On September 29, Zwingli and Oecolampadius, representing the
Swiss, came to Marburg, as guests of Philip of Hesse. Bucer, Hedio, and
Jacob Sturm represented Strasburg; Jonas, Cruciger, Myconius, and
Menuis; besides Luther and Melanchthon, represented Wittenberg.

At the first meeting, which was held on October 1, Luther And
Melanchthon engaged Oecolampadius and Zwingli, respectively, in private
conferences. But, apart from the burning question of the Sacrament, the
latter only succeeded in removing some suspicions of the Wittenberg
theologians against the doctrines of the Zurich reformer.

The second day witnessed a solemn public disputation between Luther, on
the one hand, and Zwingli and Oecolampadius on the other. Luther had
written on the table the words of institution in large letters: "This is
my Body." In response to the sophistical arguments of his opponents, he
always repeated, after expounding the contrary thesis, that he would not
yield one tittle of these clear words. Without yielding his position,
Zwingli cordially demanded that they come to a fraternal agreement.

After the conference had continued for three days, and a number of
futile meetings had been held, it was decided, upon motion of the
Landgrave, that at least a fraternal union, as desired by Zwingli,
should be established. But Luther refused to accept the hand that was
extended to him; for to him the existing theological differences about
the Eucharist appeared prohibitive. When Zwingli pleaded for Christian
charity, Luther was prepared to grant the request, provided it meant
love of peace. He stuck to his oft-repeated declaration: "You have a
spirit which differs from ours," perceiving and fearing the frank
rationalism of Zwingli, and believing it was this spirit which induced
Zwingli to regard the existing point of controversy as not so important
as to become an obstacle to the union of both parties, and that
eventually it would induce him to abandon all religion.

The Fifteen Articles of Marburg, personally composed by Luther, were to
constitute a bulwark against the danger of infidelity, which he secretly
feared.#footnote["#emph[Marburger Gespräch und Marburger Artikel];"
Weimar ed., Vol. XXX, III, pp. 110 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. LXV, pp. 88
sqq.] Contrary to his expectations, however, they were accepted by the
Swiss and Strasburg theologians. They expressed Luther’s position
relative to the Trinity, Christology, faith and justification, Baptism
and private confession. A further article, superscribed, "On the
Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ," agrees with Zwingli in its
negative aspect, namely, in its opposition to Catholicism; for it
repudiates the reception of the Eucharist under one species and also the
sacrifice of the Mass. This is followed by the vague declaration that
"the Sacrament is a Sacrament of the true body and blood of Jesus
Christ, and the spiritual reception of this same body and blood is
necessary for every Christian." It states, furthermore, that "we all
believe and maintain the custom of receiving the Sacrament, as it has
been given and ordained by the Word of God, the Almighty, that the
delicate consciences be thereby moved unto faith and love by the Holy
Ghost." Thereupon the existing dissension relative to the doctrine of
the Eucharist is expressly admitted and the necessity of charity (to a
certain degree) is taught: "Although we have not at this time settled
the question whether the true body and blood of Christ are corporeally
in the bread and wine, nevertheless, Christian charity, to the extent
that every one’s conscience can tolerate, should be mutually manifested
by both factions, who should diligently supplicate Almighty God to
confirm us in the right understanding through His spirit."

Thus the opponents separated, having settled nothing. In the practical
field of the religious life the schism opened by the new theology grew
proportionately wider. Fortunately for Germany, one good result came of
this conference, namely, that the plan of an alliance against the
Emperor and the Empire, as fostered by Zwingli and the Landgrave of
Hesse, failed to materialize.

Although intimate union with the Swiss reformers was frustrated, the
Zwinglian doctrines continued to make progress in a portion of Germany.
In many parishes of the Swabian and Alemannic districts, there arose a
powerful Zwinglian faction. The Swiss doctrine and idea of the Church,
combined with the denudation of altars, the destruction of sacred
images, and certain political projects, extended down the Rhine from
Basle over Strasburg into the Netherlands.

In virtue of the attitude of Luther and his Elector, an alliance of the
Upper German Zwinglians with the Wittenberg reformers became impossible.
Nuremberg on the whole followed Luther, whereas Ulm expressly joined the
so-called "Burgrecht" of Zurich. The result was dissension everywhere.

Luther looked in vain for another bridge to span the chasm. He caused
the so-called Articles of Schwabach to be proposed to the towns of Upper
Germany.#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXX, III, pp. 86 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol.
XXIV, 2nd ed., pp. 334 sqq. Cfr. H. v. Schubert in the #emph[Zeitschrift
für Kirchengeschichte];, XXIX (1918), pp. 342] These articles had been
drawn up by the theologians of Wittenberg in July or August, and were
more or less opposed to the Zwinglians. On the sixteenth of October they
were rejected by Strasburg and Ulm at a congress held in Schwabach and
likewise at a convention held at Schmalkalden on November 29. Landgrave
Philip, whom Luther regarded with suspicion, oscillated between the two
great factions of the new religion, whilst Zwingli hoped, through the
mediation of the Landgrave, "to isolate Wittenberg and thus finally to
make it agreeable to his plans."#footnote[G. Kawerau, #emph[Reformation
und Gegenreformation];, 3rd ed., p. 104.]
