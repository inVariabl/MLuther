== New Doctrinal and Controversial Writings
<new-doctrinal-and-controversial-writings>
Luther’s efforts to regulate doctrine and religious discipline are
associated with the publication of his two catechisms, which have
attained great significance. They originated in three series of
catechetical sermons preached in 1528. At that time it was a prescribed
custom at Wittenberg to preach week-day sermons on the catechism four
times a year, for two consecutive weeks.

"The Little Catechism, for children and simple folk," first appeared in
the form of tables, designed to be affixed to various parts of the home
according to Catholic custom. Its arrangement, particularly the sequence
of Commandments, profession. of faith, and "Our Father," also followed
the old tradition. A section on Baptism and another on the Eucharist
were appended. Its arrangement in the form of questions and answers is a
model of simplicity and clearness. Though heterodox doctrines are
emphasized in the Little Catechism, polemical attacks upon the ancient
Church are avoided. In the preface, however, the bishops are blamed for
the ignorance of Christian doctrine existing among the common people,
especially in the villages.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];]

The Large Catechism was intended to instruct pastors and to enable them
to explain the smaller one in their sermons. It is not composed in the
form of questions and answers, and is rather prolix. Nevertheless,
certain characteristic doctrines, which were apt to give rise to
dispute, are omitted, as in the case of the smaller book. Thus the
readers are not informed of their right to pass judgment on the Bible
and on matters of faith, two things formerly so strongly emphasized by
Luther. Its pages are silent on the doctrine of original sin as the
destroyer of every inclination to good, on the enslaved will, and on
predestination.

The two catechisms were very widely adopted and often reprinted.
Numerous Electoral regulations provided for their propagation and use.
In 1580 they were incorporated in the "Book of Concord" and thereby
raised to the rank of symbolical writings of the Lutheran Church.

It cannot be denied that the desire not to be outdone by Luther proved
very beneficial to the development of Catholic catechetics. The
religious instruction of the people, it is true, had not been neglected.
To them Luther holds up his own example. Even in his manner of
presentation he completely followed the old
method.#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, pp. 489 sqq.]

But the copiousness and systematic method of Catholic religious
instruction necessitated a certain gradation. It became necessary that
it should be transferred from the home, to which it had been previously
entrusted, to the school and the church. Then, too, the existing and
quite estimable number of elementary textbooks had to be multiplied. The
splendid work of Peter Canisius perfected the great amount of good
literature which was already in existence.

Luther believed himself justified in stating that, prior to his time,
there had been "no doctor on earth who had known the whole of the
catechism, that is, the Our Father, the Ten Commandments and the Creed,
much less understood them and taught them as now, God be praised, they
are taught and learned even by little children. In support of this I
appeal to all their books, those of the theologians as well as those of
the lawyers. If even one article of the catechism can be learnt aright
from them, I shall allow myself to be broken on the wheel or bled to
death."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];, p. 485] He is better advised when he
recommends people to occupy themselves with the study of the catechism.
He makes his recommendations in a manner characteristic of himself. In
the preface to the Large Catechism he tells his preachers that whoever
does not heed and abide by the catechism, is to be classified with the
"shameful gluttons and belly-servers, who are better fitted to look
after the pigs and the hounds than to be pastors having the cure of
souls."#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];] Daily, every morning and evening, he
himself, though a doctor and preacher, recited “the

Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Our Father, etc., like a child.” The
preface exhorts all pastors "to practice well and always to occupy
themselves with" the catechism, and contains many practical ideas, in
proposing which Luther pleads with those "lazy bellies or presumptuous
saints, that, for God’s sake, they let themselves be persuaded." His
words have borne fruit, and in many Protestant districts his catechisms
have established and sustained positive Christian beliefs.

Other minor writings support the Little Catechism. Thus, in 1526, he
wrote a little treatise on the ceremonies of Baptism, which supplied the
majority of Lutheran churches with the trinitarian formula and the
exorcism. In 1529, he composed a "Small Book on the Marriage Ceremony
for Simple Pastors," which exercised a similar influence on the marriage
rite. According to the latter work, the nuptial ceremony is a blessing
joined with prayer, freely solicited by the bridal couple, but not
necessary for the validity of marriage.

At the head of his treatise "Von Ehesachen,"#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol.
XXX, III, pp. 205 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXIII, pp. 93 sqq.] which he
commenced in 1529 and published in 1530, as well as in other writings,
Luther enunciates the doctrine, which he makes the basis and
starting-point of his instructions, that Matrimony is not a Sacrament,
but "a purely temporal matter, such as raiment and food, house and
courtyard, subject to secular authority." The matrimonial problems with
which he had been overwhelmed, had crushed him. After the Catholic laws
on matrimony had been discarded, great confusion inevitably ensued, and
this disorder was augmented by the Peasants’ War and the moral decadence
which followed. "I have a lot of trouble with it," he writes to
Spalatin; "I resist strongly, cry out and exclaim that such matters
should be left to the secular authorities."#footnote[Similarly in a
letter to Spalatin, January 7, 1527 (#emph[Briefwechsel];, VI, p. 6), in
consequence of the experience "that mankind could not be governed by the
gospel."] In the treatise mentioned, as elsewhere in his writings, he
does not propose to give any regulations pertaining to Matrimony, since
temporal matters do not pertain to the clergy and the Church has no
right "to govern or to enforce the law," but her province is "to inform
and console the consciences." Hence, he speaks only as one offering
advice.

It is not necessary to demonstrate that his usual distinction between
the Church and the world, between the spiritual kingdom of Christ and
the external realm of the civil authority, between the forum of law and
the forum of conscience, was bound to involve him in vacillations and
contradictions, especially in the realm of Matrimony. An arbitrary
subjectivism all too frequently replaces objective law in his teaching.
Because this teaching–if it be possible to speak of uniform teaching
–sprang from the soil of his passionate attacks on the religious vows
and sacerdotal celibacy, it had a sensuous and dangerous
aspect.#footnote[Cf. S. Baranowski, #emph[Luthers Lehre von der Ehe];,
Münster i. W., 1913, especially the summaries at pp. 4 sqq. and 207
sqq.]

Nevertheless, he extols Matrimony as a dignified, yea, sublime
institution of divine provenience and delineates the natural side of
conjugal life in glowing phrases. He even boastfully claims that it was
he who "sang the praises" of the matrimonial state "in sermons,
writings, and examples," whereas the papists did not recognize harlotry
as a sin.#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weim. ed., Vol. IV, n. 5116.] It
is surprising to note how many Protestant writers repeat this
self-praise and at the same time overlook the tangible shortcomings
inherent in Luther’s theory of matrimony as well as the fatal
consequences of that theory when put into practice.

In his book "Von Ehesachen" Luther refrains from dealing with the
confused mass of questions which had arisen from the new concept of
Matrimony. For the jurists, even Schurf at Wittenberg, strictly defended
many of the traditional canonical regulations and interpretations
against his liberal notions. On the matrimonial impediments,
particularly those derived from consanguinity, as well as on divorce,
Luther expresses himself only in a cursory manner. He concedes the right
of divorce on the grounds of adultery and malevolent desertion.

One of the principal objects of this work is to combat clandestine
marriages contracted without parental consent. Matrimony, so he teaches,
is a public state of life and hence must be contracted publicly, in the
presence of witnesses and in the sight of the congregation. Clandestine
marriages contracted against the wishes of father and mother or their
representatives, are null and void. However, the rights of parents
should not be exaggerated. If parents wantonly prevent their children
from marrying, he says, the civil authority or, in the event of the
latter’s refusal, the pastor, with the assistance of worthy friends,
should permit and confirm the marriage. Luther was confronted with
severe conflicts with the secular authorities because of his opposition
to the constantly increasing secret marriages, or secret betrothals, as
he termed them. Because of his vexatious experiences with matrimonial
problems, his disgust increased to such an extent that he subsequently
wrote to Count Albrecht of Mansfeld: "I have cast it \[the matter of
regulating marriages\] from me and have written to several persons that,
in the name of all the devils, they should do as they see
fit."#footnote[October 5, 1536; Erl. ed., Vol. LV, p. 147
(#emph[Briefwechsel];, XI, p. 90).]

Among other works written by Luther, mention should be made of. his
"Reply to the Libel of the King of England," written in
1527,#footnote[Weimar ed., XVIII, pp. 26 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXX, pp. I
sqq.] –a crude rejoinder to the published reply of Henry VIII in which
the latter declined to cooperate with Luther, who had previously
endeavored to interest the King in his cause. In his rejoinder Luther
says that he "upholds his doctrine in defiance not only of princes and
kings, but of all the devils." No less violent is his tract "On Secret
and Purloined Letters,"#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXX, II, pp. 25 sqq.;
Erl. ed.,, Vol. XXXI, pp. 1 sqq.] written in 1529 against Duke George of
Saxony, in connection with the affair of the alleged secret league of
the Catholic princes for the destruction of Lutheranism, discovered by
Otto von Pack. Luther had written a letter on this subject to his friend
Link, which had come into the possession of the Duke and was made public
by him, to the chagrin of the writer. In this letter, as well as in the
tract written to defend it, Luther asserts the existence of the League,
which had already at that time been shown to be a myth, and maintained
that George and his counselors were possessed by the devil, and
consequently he (Luther) was constrained to believe that they harbored
most wicked designs.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. III, pp. 325
sq., V, P. 343.]

In 1527, Luther dedicated two treatises to the two "martyrs" of his
theological system, as he calls them. One of these is entitled,
"Consolation to the Christians of Halle on the Death of their Preacher,
George \[Winkler\]"; the other is a tract on "Leonard Kaiser, who was
Burnt in Bavaria for the Gospel."#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXIII, pp.
401 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXII, pp. 294 sqq. and Weim. ed., Vol. XXIII,
p. 452; #emph[Briefwechsel];, VI, pp. 156 sqq.] Winkler had been
attacked and murdered in 1527 by unascertained culprits. Without proof,
Luther accuses the canons of Mayence of being accessories to the crime.
The second "martyr," Leonard Kaiser (Käser), was a Bavarian ex-priest
who had studied at Wittenberg and was executed at Schirding after being
tried for heresy by Ernest of Bavaria, administrator of the bishop of
Passau.

In his printed message "To the Christians of Bremen"#footnote[Erl. ed.,
Vol. XXVI, 2nd ed., pp. 40 sqq. (#emph[Briefwechsel];, V, p. 112.).]
Luther glorified several other "martyrs": two Augustinians of Brussels;
the Augustinian Henry of Zitphen (Henry Müller, died 1524); Caspar
Tauber, who was burnt at the stake in Vienna in 1524; a Lutheran
colporteur named George, who was executed in the same year at Ofen, and
an unknown individual of Prague. He pathetically exclaims that "their
blood would drown the papacy and its god, the devil."#footnote[Letter to
Hausmann, November 17, 1524; Erl. ed., Vol. XXVI, 2nd ed., p. 403
(#emph[Briefwechsel];, V, p. 112).]

If several of his later utterances were taken seriously, many more
bloody victims of his party would have to be included among the
"martyrs" of the new faith. The number mentioned has been increased by
historical authorities; for the medieval laws against heretics continued
in operation. According to Riezler it is possible to demonstrate that in
Bavaria, which was accused of being especially cruel, relatively few
obstinate heretics were executed. In Württemberg, it appears, capital
punishment was more frequently inflicted upon apostate Catholics. But it
must be recalled that many of those who were executed there and
elsewhere were guilty of participation in the revolts connected with the
Peasants’ War as well as of other crimes which constituted one of the
grounds, if not the chief ground, for their execution. Others were put
to death because of their Anabaptist doctrines and machinations, which
were dangerous to the State; and for this reason Lutheranism cannot
claim them as confessors. A case in point is the frequently cited one of
Balthasar Hubmaier, who, having come into prominence as an apostle of
the revolutionary Anabaptist movement, was burnt at the stake in 1527.
In every religious conflict there the have been deluded individuals who
wrought up their errors to the very point of dangerous madness and did
not hesitate to risk their very lives. The history of the severe laws
formulated against heresy since the early Middle Ages furnishes ample
proof of this statement.

Among the polemical tracts which Luther issued against Catholic worship,
is his "Advice to a Dear Friend on Both Forms of the Sacrament in Reply
to the Mandate of the Bishop of Meissen," published in
1528.#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXVI, pp. 560 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXX,
pp. 373 sqq.] The exclusion of the laity from the chalice, decreed for
practical reasons by the Church, constituted one of the chief grounds of
attack against her. When, in 1528, the bishop of Meissen renewed his
regulations proscribing the use of the chalice for the laity, the
Lutherans availed themselves of these regulations in order to attack the
Church, and this afforded Luther an occasion to recapitulate his former
alleged proofs in support of the reception of the Sacrament under both
forms by the laity. The papal Church, thus he declared in opposition to
the bishop, sets the Word of God at naught in this respect, thereby
proving that she is the Church of the devil and the bride of Satan.

The following two years saw a series of excellent Catholic replies
relative to the lay-chalice. The authors easily demonstrated that the
reception of the Eucharist under the form of bread alone does not
constitute a mutilation of the Sacrament, as Luther, appealing to the
alleged "clear, forceful words of Christ," contended. They demonstrated
that the blood of Christ as well as His divinity were inseparably united
with His body. The Church in introducing the custom of giving the host
alone to the laity, because of the danger that the consecrated wine be
spilled or profaned, was within her rights, as she was the administrator
of the Sacraments for the glory of God. The demand for the chalice was
not prompted by zeal for divine worship, but rather founded upon a
spirit of opposition and provocation, since the adherents of the new
religion did not exhibit any great activity in the reception of the
Eucharist, and since, moreover, most of them did not desire to receive
the Eucharist under either form. Among those who defended the
traditional practice we find, for example, the Dominican Michael Vehe of
Halle, who, in a treatise, "On the Law of the Reception of the Holy
Sacrament," composed in 1531, which was a model of objectivity and
calmness, demonstrated the right of Cardinal Albrecht to prohibit the
faithful at Halle to receive their Easter communion under both
species.#footnote[N. Paulus, #emph[Die Dominikaner im Kampf gegen
Luther];, pp. 219 sq.]

By means of popular polemical pictures Luther endeavored to arouse the
passions of the people against the papal Church. In a pamphlet, "A
Vision of Friar Claus in Switzerland,"#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXVI,
pp. 130 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. LXIII, pp. 260 sqq. Cf. Grisar-Heege,
#emph[Luthers Kampfbilder];, Vol. III (#emph[Lutherstudien];, n. 5), pp.
44–56, with illustrations, especially p. 53.] published in 1528, he
circulated an alleged vision of the papacy had by Blessed Nicholas von
der Flüe, which, he pretended, exhibited to the world Rome’s
"tyrannical, murderous, bloody dominion over body and soul." He sees in
this utterly unhistorical representation a dismal head, crowned with a
tiara, whence six pointed swords are projected. In Luther’s mystical
interpretation, the triply serrated beard signifies the three classes of
men who adhere to the pope, "the sanctimonious, such as monks, priests,
and nuns; the scholars, such as jurists, theologians, #emph[magistri];;
the mighty of the earth, such as kings, princes, and lords." The
pamphlet is a mental aberration, corresponding to its author’s frame of
mind.

Very bitter, even if droll, are the supplements which he appends to his
"New Intelligence of Leipsic" and "The Fable of the Lion and the
Ass."#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXVI, pp. 539 sqq.; Vol. LIII, pp. 549
sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. LXIV, pp. 324 sqq. Cf. Grisar-Heege, #emph[l.c.];,
pp. 37–44, with illustrations, especially p. 43.] Two authors of
Leipsic, John Hasenberg and Joachim von Heyden, had attacked Luther’s
marriage to Catherine of Bora. The above-mentioned document was intended
to be Luther’s reply, or, at any rate, a sort of reply. The former work
is ornamented with a square, in which the word ASINI is written with
checkered letters in such wise that, commencing with the center, the
word "ass" can be read forty times. The fate which, as he tells us, the
writings of the two Leipsic authors were to experience at his hands in
his private chamber cannot be described in decent language. The second
of these tracts depicts how the ass is made king of beasts; it is aimed
at the pope, whom the Leipsic professors honored, but whom Luther
frequently describes as "pope-ass." An artistic illustration; furnished
by Cranach, which accompanies the work, presents two young asses,
#emph[asini Lipsienses];, holding a large crown above the head of a
braying, lean old ass, which is followed by two young prancing asses,
carrying halberds on their shoulders. The text ironically ascribes to
the pope-ass "the ability to administer both the temporal and the
spiritual government" and asserts that there is "nothing about the
entire ass which is not worthy of royal and papal honors."

Quite serious was Luther’s literary warfare against the Anabaptists. His
"Address to Two Pastors on Re-baptizing," published in 1528, was
particularly characteristic.#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXVI, pp. 144
sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXVI, 2nd ed., pp. 281 sqq.] Contrary to the
principal objection of the re-baptizers, namely, that infants could not
possibly have the faith which Luther required as a condition for the
efficacy of the Sacrament, he obstinately asserts that children can and
do have the faith and denounces as a vain conceit the statement that
they are as yet devoid of reason. The constant practice of the Church
supplies him with a bulwark in support of Infant Baptism. The Church
could not have been permitted by God to remain in error for so long a
time. He speaks on this topic as if he did not accuse the preceding
centuries of the Christian era of the most glaring errors in other
essential doctrines. When he was in an agitated frame of mind, he took
no account of such contradictions.

The writings which were evoked by Luther’s controversy with Zwingli
occupy a special place among his literary productions.
