== Interior State
<interior-state>
The last sentence quoted above contains a remarkable declaration about
his spiritual condition and his compliance with his monastic duties at
that time. He seldom found time to recite the Divine Office and to say
Mass. It was his duty so to arrange his affairs as to be able to comply
with these obligations. The canonical hours were strictly prescribed.
Saying Mass is the central obligation of every priest, especially if he
is a member of a religious order. If Luther did not know how to observe
due moderation in his labors; if he was derelict in the principal duties
of the spiritual life; it was to be feared that he would gradually drift
away from the religious state, particularly in view of the fact that he
had adopted a false Mysticism which favored the relaxation of the rule.
As rural vicar, it is probable that he did not sustain among the
brethren the good old spirit which the zealous Proles had introduced
into the society. Of the "temptations of the flesh" which he mentions we
learn nothing definite. He was not yet in conflict with his vows. His
wrestlings with the devil may signify the fears and terrors to which he
was subject.

He continued to be on good terms with his friend Staupitz, who was
interested in the young monk’s manifold activities. Staupitz also posed
as a mystic, and favored the spiritual tendency which Luther followed.
This talented and sociable man was very popular as a useful adviser in
the homes of the rich and as an entertainer at table. Whilst Luther
could not accompany him on such errands, he enjoyed his company on
monastic visitations. In July, 1515, he accompanied Staupitz to
Eisleben, when the latter opened the new Augustinian monastery at that
place. As he walked in his sacerdotal vestments in the procession
through the city of his birth at the side of his vicar, who carried the
Blessed Sacrament, Luther was suddenly seized with unspeakable fright at
the thought of the proximity of Christ. On mentioning the incident to
his superior afterwards, the latter comforted him by saying: "Your
thought is not Christ," and assuring him that Christ did not desire this
fear.#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., Vol. I, Nr. 137.] At
times, in consequence either of a disordered affection of the heart or
of overwork, he was so distressed that he could not eat or drink for a
long time. One day he was found seemingly dead in his cell, so
completely was he exhausted as a result of agitation and lack of food.
His friend Ratzeberger, a physician, mentions this incident, without,
however, indicating the exact time of its occurrence. Luther was
relieved of this pitiable condition by recourse to music, which always
stimulated him. After he had regained his strength, he was able once
more to prosecute his labors. As a result of his suffering and worry he
became very much emaciated.

Did Luther subject himself to extraordinary deeds of penance at any
period of his monastic life, as he frequently affirmed in his subsequent
conflict with the papacy and monasticism, when he was impelled by
polemical reasons to describe himself as the type of a holy and
mortified monk, one who could not find peace of mind during his whole
monastic career? Holding then that peace of mind was simply impossible
in the Catholic Church, he arbitrarily misrepresents monasticism, in
order to exhibit in a most glaring manner the alleged inherent
impossibility of "papistic" ethics to produce the assurance of God’s
mercy. "I tormented my body by fasting, vigils, and cold …In the
observance of these matters I was so precise and superstitious, that I
imposed more burdens upon my body than it could bear without danger to
health." "If ever a monk got to heaven by monkery, then I should have
got there." "I almost died a-fasting, for often I took neither a drop of
water nor a morsel of food for three days."#footnote[See the passages
quoted by me in #emph[Luther];, Vol. VI, pp. 191 sqq. A special chapter
in that volume (pp. 187 sqq.) discusses "Luther’s Later Embellishment of
His Early Life" in the various phases of its development.]

Such exaggerated penitential exercises were prohibited by the statutes
of the congregation, which were distinguished for great discretion, and
insisted upon proper moderation as a matter of strict duty.

The above picture of singular holiness is produced not by early
witnesses, but by assertions which Luther made little by little at a
later period of life. The established facts contradict the legend.
Perhaps his description is based partly on reminiscences of his
distracted days in the monastery, or on eccentric efforts to overcome
his sombre moods by means of a false piety. His greatest error, and the
one which most betrays him, is that he ascribes his fictitious
asceticism to all serious-minded members of his monastery, yea, of all
monasteries. He would have it that all monks consumed themselves in
wailing and grief, wrestling for the peace of God, until he supplied the
remedy.#footnote[Cf. Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. II, pp. 157 sqq.] It
is a rule of the most elementary criticism finally to cut loose from the
distorted presentation of the matter which has maintained itself so
tenaciously in Protestant biographies of Luther. It may be admitted
that, on the whole, Luther was a dutiful monk for the greatest part of
his monastic life. "When I was in the monastery," he stated on one
occasion, in 1535, "I was not like the rest of men, the robbers, the
unjust, the adulterous; but I observed chastity, obedience, and
poverty."#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol. VI, pp. 233 sqq.]

Yet, after his transfer to Wittenberg, and in consequence of the
applause which was accorded to him there, the unpleasant traits of his
character, especially his positive insistence on always being in the
right, began to manifest themselves more and more disagreeably. In his
opinion, the Scholastic theologians, even the greatest among them, were
sophists. They were a herd of "swine theologians," while he was the
enlightened pupil of St. Paul and St. Augustine.#footnote[#emph[Op.
cit,];, Vol. I, pp. 130 sqq.] The finer achievements of Scholasticism,
especially those of its intellectual giant, Thomas of Aquin, were
scarcely known to him. Could his confused mysticism perhaps supplement
his deficient knowledge of Scholasticism? No, it only made him more
self-conscious and arbitrary in the sphere of theology. He gave free
vent to his criticism of highly respected ascetical writers. An example
of his egotistical excess in this respect is furnished by his glosses
for the year 1515, which he indited on the Psalter of Mary, a work of
Mark of Weida.#footnote[#emph[Theol. Studien u. Kritiken];, 1917, pp. 81
sqq.]

In addition to these characteristics, there was his peculiar
irritability, which is strikingly exhibited in his correspondence during
1514. The theologians of Erfurt, led by Nathin, had reproved him for
taking the doctorate at Erfurt instead of at Wittenberg, since the
Erfurt school had claims on him as one of its own pupils. It is possible
that some harsh words were exchanged in regard to this matter. The young
professor in a letter addressed to the monastery at Erfurt says that he
had well nigh resolved to "pour out the entire vial of his wrath and
indignation upon Nathin and the whole monastery" on account of their
lies and mockery. They had received two shocking letters (#emph[litterae
stupidae];) from him, for which he now wants to excuse himself, though
his indignation "was only too well founded," especially since he now
heard even worse things about Nathin and his complaints against his
(Luther’s) person. In the meantime, God had willed his separation from
the Erfurt monastery, etc.

The ill-feeling between Nathin and his Erfurt colleagues, on the one
hand, and Luther and his monastic partisans on the other, arose from the
controversy concerning the stricter observance of the rule within the
Order.
