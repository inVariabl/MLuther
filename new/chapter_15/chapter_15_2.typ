== Luther’s Illness at Schmalkalden. New Polemics
<luthers-illness-at-schmalkalden.-new-polemics>
The illness with which Luther was seized at Schmalkalden was a violent
attack of gallstone, an old trouble which had become greatly aggravated.
He was no longer able to participate in the conferences of the
convention. In fact, people began to fear for his life. Although he was
suffering intense pains and thinking of death, he would not allow even a
thought of reconciliation to arise in his soul. On the contrary, he
prayed as follows: "O God, Thou knowest that I have taught Thy Word
faithfully and zealously …I die in hatred of the
pope."#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];, Weimar ed., Vol. VI, n. 6974;
Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. III, p. 435.] Once, when racked with pains,
he said to a chamberlain of his Elector that his death would be a source
of joy to the pope, but the latter’s elation would not be of long
duration; for the truth of the epitaph which he (Luther) had prepared,
would remain. The tenor of this epitaph was that his death would be the
death of the pope: "#emph[Pestis eram vivus, moriens ero mors tua,
papa.];" This horrible hexameter, it is true, is not inscribed on his
tomb at Wittenberg, but since about 1572, it appears upon a huge
memorial tablet with his effigy which had originally been destined for
Wittenberg, but was transferred to Jena.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];,
Vol. III, p. 436; Vol. V, p. 102; Vol. VI, pp. 370, 377, 389, 394, 395
sq.]

He did not want to die at Schmalkalden, but in the company of his
friends at Wittenberg; for he did not wish the papal nuncio, the "legate
of the devil," to enjoy the satisfaction of seeing him die in his
immediate vicinity. Accordingly, on February 26, he was conveyed to a
coach that was to carry him home. A multitude surrounded him as he was
about to depart. He made the sign of the cross over them and said: "May
the Lord fill you with His blessing and with hatred of the pope." Such
was "his last will and testament," according to an expression of
Mathesius in his eleventh sermon on Luther,” who adds: "He \[Luther\]
bequeathed to his friends, the preachers, #emph[odium in
papam];."#footnote[Mathesius, #emph[Historien] (1566), p. 130;
Köstlin-Kawerau, #emph[M. Luther];, Vol. II, p. 389; Grisar, Luther,
Vol. III, p. 435.]

On the very next day after his departure Luther experienced an
improvement in his health. Having arrived at Gotha, after an exhausting
journey, he made a will in writing–his so-called First Testament –in
which he expressed the wish that he might live until Pentecost, in order
to attack the Roman beast with even greater vigor than he had done
before. In this testament he assures the princes that they need not
worry over the spoliation of church property. "They do not rob like some
others do; indeed, I see how, with these goods, they provide for the
welfare of religion."#footnote[Grisar, #emph[op. cit.];, Vol. III, p.
437.] It was more of an attempted easing of his own conscience than a
statement in conformity with the truth. According to the reports of his
friends, he went to confession at Gotha, as was his wont, and received
absolution from Bugenhagen.

He arrived safely at Wittenberg on March 14, his health having greatly
improved.

When, during the ensuing period, his strength and ambition flagged, he
stimulated himself by resorting to a remedy which always proved
effective. He filled himself with hatred of the pope. "Then my mind is
completely refreshed," he says in his #emph[Table Talks];; "the spirit
is quickened and all temptations flee."#footnote[#emph[Tischreden];,
Weimar ed., Vol. II, no. 2410.] Certain phenomena of his inner life can
hardly be judged by ordinary standards. The idea of the devil being at
work in the papacy distorts all his thoughts. In the case of abnormal
phenomena, among which we must reckon his imprecatory prayer, puzzling
psychological problems constantly recur. He is not the victim of fixed
ideas; for free-will and accountability are clearly operative in his
case; but his guilt is diminished when the psychopathic condition which
oppressed him since his youth and the monastic period is taken into
consideration.#footnote[See the chapter: "The Darker Sides of Luther’s
Inner Life," Grisar, Luther, Vol. VI, pp. 99–186.] Moreover, many pages
of the works and letters which he composed at Wittenberg betray this
nervous condition, which was accompanied by heart disease and precordial
dread.

In 1538 he published his Schmalkaldic Articles, which the convention of
1537 had suppressed, intensifying many of their polemical
acerbities.#footnote[See #emph[supra];, n. 1.] He represented these
articles in this work as a document which had been approved by the
convention, saying they were "adopted unanimously acknowledged by our
party," in order that “they might be "publicly submitted and introduced
as our profession of faith" before a truly free council of the church.
This assertion was false and it cannot be established how Luther came to
make it. Can it be assumed that he had no reliable information with
respect to the actual proceedings of the convention of
Schmalkalden?#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. III, p. 440, note
2.]

In the same year (1538) Luther published a revision of his "Instruction
of the Visitators to the Parsons," in which, besides some good
exhortations, he directed the parsons to "condemn vehemently the papacy
and its adherents."#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. XXVI, pp. 195 sqq.; Erl.
ed., Vol. XXIII, p. 57. Cfr. Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. III, p. 438.]

The larger work of the succeeding year, "On the Councils and the
Churches,"#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. L, pp. 509 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol.
XXV, 2 ed., pp. 278 sqq. Cfr. Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. V, pp. 377
sqq.; 106 sq.] was the execution of a proposal made by Amsdorf, who had
suggested that he once and for all thoroughly repulse the Erasmians and
all papists who appealed to the Church and proclaimed her right of
rendering final decisions. Luther said that people constantly clamored
for "the Church, the Church, the Church," in order to destroy his
gospel. With an impetuous diligence he read the history of ancient
councils and other ecclesiastical documents in order to find material to
deny the authority of the Church. The tone of this work, which is
written in a self-conscious, provocative, and abusive style, constitutes
a psychological problem, despite its somewhat scholarly form. "Whoever
teaches differently \[than we\], though he be an angel from heaven," he
says, "let him be anathema" (Gal. 1:8). "We desire to be the pope’s
masters and to trample him under foot," etc. The pope must "side with
us" in the proposed council. "Emperors and kings ought to cooperate in
this matter and coerce the pope into compliance." Such statements were
apt to enlighten certain blind men in Germany who still good-naturedly
believed that peace could be brought about by way of negotiations and
religious colloquies. These so-called expectants believed that they
could keep the Lutheran question in abeyance by means of a few
concessions, until the ecumenical council convened.

Cardinal Albrecht of Mayence seems to have held this opinion. His
immoral private life blinded his intellect and rendered his character
weak. Luther was enraged at him because he had thus far declined to join
the reformers. He employed the affair of a certain Anton Schonitz to
vent his resentment against Albrecht in a violent pamphlet, entitled:
"Against Cardinal Albrecht, Archbishop at Magdeburg ,"#footnote[Weimar
ed., Vol. L, pp. 395 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXXII, pp. 14 sqq. Cfr.
Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. V, pp. 106 sq.] which he caused to be
printed against the express wish of his Elector, who did not desire to
see his colleague insulted. After the book appeared, Luther had to
promise the Elector not to publish anything of a personal matter without
the previous censorship of the electoral curia. The incident furnished
the weak Cardinal Albrecht with an opportunity of seeing how little hope
there was of effecting a conciliation with the innovators. We may add
that a few years later a change came over the Cardinal. A new spirit
animated Mayence and its archiepiscopal court, stimulated by the
activity of Giovanni Morone, the papal legate, and of Bl. Peter Faber, a
companion of St. Ignatius, who came to that city in 1541. The spiritual
exercises conducted by Faber influenced the worldly-minded Cardinal and
induced him to become a defender of the Church and to lead a better life
until his death, which occurred in 1545.#footnote[Cfr. Grisar,
#emph[Luther] (German original), Vol. III, pp. 1025 sq. (omitted in the
English translation by E. M. (Lamond).]

Duke Henry of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel was one of the bitterest
opponents of the religious revolt. He was a personal enemy of John
Frederick of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse. He was accused of
many deeds of violence and led an immoral life. He was also an author
and wrote a vigorous attack upon the Protestant princes and the new
Church at New Year’s, 1541. With impetuous haste, Luther, though
afflicted with violent ear-ache, replied to him in a pamphlet entitled,
"Against the Clown" (#emph[Wider Hans Worst];)#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol.
LI, pp. 469 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXVI, 2 ed., pp. 19 sqq.]

The contents of this work are in accord with its contemptuous title.
This uncouth lout, Luther says, is at the same time a disgraceful liar
in his attacks upon the alleged evangelical heretics. In this work as
well as in the one "On the Councils" Luther proposed to show where the
true Church was. It is not with the papists, who lack twelve essential
parts; the true and ancient Christian Church is rather on his (Luther’s)
side. The devil’s harlot is an epithet which he applies to the papal
Church, while Duke Henry, the loutish clown, is characterized as an
incendiary and a dastard, who is forced to hear evil reports because of
his immoral conduct.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. IV, p. 64.]
Luther wrote to Melanchthon that he marveled at himself because he had
observed such moderation in the composition of this book.#footnote[April
12, 1541; see #emph[Briefwechsel];, XIII, p. 300, on his book
#emph[Contra istum diabolum Mezentium.] Mezentius was a notorious
tyrant.]

In 1537, Luther became involved in an exciting feud with antinomianism.
John Agricola of Eisleben, afterwards of Wittenberg, a former friend of
Luther and one of his most renowned theologians, passionately declaimed
against the law of Christian morality. He contended that the law did not
effect true penance, but death and damnation. He wanted conversion and
penance to be the product of love. For a considerable number of years,
Luther had been wont to concede greater effectiveness to the law and the
fear of punishment than he had granted in the early part of his career.
Now the unsparing attacks of Agricola violently aroused him, especially
since that writer quoted former statements of his own. He condemned the
doctrine of Agricola as antinomianism, #emph[i.e.];, perversion of the
law.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. V, pp. 15–25.] On December
18, he delivered a discourse against the antinomian theses, which,
however, Agricola refused to acknowledge as his own. The controversy
aroused widespread attention. Luther’s friends, among them Amsdorf,
bitterly complained that the pupils pretended to be wiser than their
master. Luther arranged a second disputation for January 12, 1538, to
justify his former position. This was followed by a third, on September
13, which proved to be an extraordinarily lengthy argument against the
new "spiritual blusterers" and "conscious
hypocrites."#footnote[#emph[Disputationes];, ed. Drews, Disp. I, pp. 246
sqq.; II, pp. 334 sqq.; III, pp. 419 sqq.]

Luther’s work, "Against the Antinomians," published in the beginning of
1539, sealed the embittered conflict with Agricola and the numerous
adherents whom the latter had attracted.#footnote[Weimar ed., Vol. L,
pp. 468 sqq.; Erl. ed., Vol. XXXII, pp. 1 sqq.] Meanwhile the founder of
antinomianism had timidly retreated from the field of battle. Luther
nevertheless printed things about him which must have hurt him keenly.
In March, 1540, Agricola brought suit against Luther before the Saxon
Elector, to whom he wrote that he had been trodden under foot for
well-nigh three years and had slunk along at Luther’s heels like a
wretched cur.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. V, p. 21.]

As a final solution, Agricola left Wittenberg about the middle of
August, 1540, and betook himself to Berlin, where a position as
court-preacher was offered to him by the Elector Joachim II of
Brandenburg, who had been converted to the new evangel.
