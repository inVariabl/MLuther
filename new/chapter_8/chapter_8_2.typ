== The Sentence of Outlawry
<the-sentence-of-outlawry>
The imperial councilors, even before the opening of the diet, had taken
the point of view that the Emperor, by virtue of his own authority, was
empowered to pronounce sentence of outlawry against Luther. The two
nuncios demanded that he issue the edict as a sacred duty, since by the
terms of his royal oath he was the sworn protector of the Church. The
high-chancellor, Gattinara, in opposition to the Saxon Elector,
announced that the edict of outlawry should be issued "with the
knowledge, but not with the counsel and consent of the
princes."#footnote[Kalkoff, #emph[Luther und die Entscheidungsjahre];,
pp. 187 sq.] On February 19, before Luther arrived in Worms, the diet
had left it to the Emperor to proclaim "the proper mandate,"
#emph[i.e.];, the sentence of outlawry in the event of Luther’s refusal
to recant. On April 20, as we saw above, the diet expressly renewed its
consent to this step. When the Emperor, without necessity, but in a
spirit of accommodation, inquired as to the best method of procedure,
the estates desired that the mandate be submitted to them, so that "at
the request of His Majesty they might indicate their opinion in this
matter." But, in matter of fact, the edict was not submitted to the
diet, whose members had already begun to scatter. Nor was it necessary
to do so. The editor of the recently published #emph[Reichstagsakten]
writes: "There can be no doubt that the Emperor was now justified in
issuing an edict in his own right, without further consultation of the
estates." Moreover, the legitimacy of the imperial edict of outlawry was
freely admitted by the estates assembled in 1524 for the diet of
Nuremberg, which declared that the edict was issued "with mature
deliberation and after the Electors, princes, and other estates had been
consulted."#footnote[Cf. Paulus, #emph[l.c.] (note 13 above), for the
documentary evidence for all these assertions.] Hence, the more recent
objection to the legality of the edict of Worms as an imperial measure
are unfounded.

The edict was drawn up under date of May 8, after Luther, whose
whereabout was kept secret from everybody, had already spent a number of
days at the Wartburg, and after his safe-conduct had expired.

This document was chiefly the work of Aleander, who unfolded therein the
whole penal system of the Middle Ages. Since the days when Christianity
issued from the catacombs, many changes had taken place in the public
relationship between Church and State and modifications had become
necessary even in the interest of practicability, if for no other
reasons. But the eyes of Aleander, the Italian, only saw the dangers
threatened by the negligence of the bishops and the immense growth of
the Lutheran movement. For this reason the nuncios, together with other
religious-minded people, prevailed upon the young Emperor, who was
zealous in his defense of the Church, to invoke the entire legal
machinery of the Middle Ages against heresy and the imminent revolt. Nor
were the traditional forceful phrases spared which denounced heresy as
the greatest of all evils.#footnote[Text of the Edict in the
#emph[Reichstagsakten];, ed. by Wrede, II, pp. 640 sqq.]

In the introductory part of the edict Charles declared that his imperial
office obliged him to protect the Church and that he was in duty bound
to heed the Providence which had entrusted him with many countries and
with greater authority to promote the welfare of Christianity than was
wielded by any of his predecessors. The protection of religion was
traditional with his family, through which, on his father’s side, he was
related to the most Christian emperors and archdukes of Austria and the
dukes of Burgundy, and also, on his mother’s side, which originated in
Spain and Sicily. Hence it was his duty to resist the new heresies,
which had originated in hell, after the pope had solemnly condemned them
and excommunicated the man who propagated them. In vain had Luther been
urged to abandon them at Worms.

The edict goes on to enumerate the errors of the heretic and recalls his
very words that, if Hus, who had been burned at the stake, was a
heretic, he himself (Luther) was a ten times greater heretic than Hus.
In addition, it says, Luther destroys obedience to authority and
publishes writings which serve but to foment revolt, schism, and bloody
dissensions. He proclaims a brand of Christian liberty destructive of
all law, the liberty of irrational beasts. The document styles him a
devil in human form and says, if Germany and other countries are not to
perish, it is the Emperor’s duty to enforce, without delay or
mitigation, "the laudable constitutions of the Christian Roman emperors,
which they promulgated for the punishment and extermination of
heretics." Therefore, Luther is declared outlawed for the whole extent
of the empire, "with the unanimous consent and will," as the document
has it, of the Electors, princes, and estates of the diet of Worms.
Consequently, no one was allowed henceforth to provide him with shelter,
food, drink, etc.; on the contrary, he is to be apprehended wherever he
may be found and surrendered to the imperial authorities. Those who
disobey the edict incur the penalties of high treason and will
themselves be treated as outlaws, liable to the forfeiture of all royal
prerogatives, feudal tenures, favors, and liberties which they received
from the emperor and the empire. The protectors and adherents of the
heretic are to be apprehended, and their property is to be given to
those who proceed against them, to be used for their own benefit.

All the literary productions of Luther, even if they incidentally
contain some good things, are to be burnt and shunned like poison. The
plague of anti-religious books, pamphlets, pictures, etc., composed by
others, as well as all libels against the pope, prelates, princes,
universities, etc., are to be exterminated. Books which in any manner
touch on matters of faith may be printed only after they have been
submitted to the censorship of a bishop or of the nearest theological
faculty. All other literary productions require the episcopal
approbation.

The strict ordinance concerning publications was intended to check an
evil which had assumed boundless proportions. The edict was in strict
accord with the severe prescriptions of Leo X and the Fifth Lateran
Council (1515) regarding preventive censorship.#footnote[Pastor,
#emph[History of the Popes];, tr. by R. Kerr, Vol. VIII, 2nd ed., 1923,
pp. 397 sq.] The new invention of the "right noble art of printing," as
it is styled in the Emperor’s edict, had degenerated in virtue of a
deluge of writings and pamphlets which disseminated errors, fostered
agitation , and preached ecclesiastical and social revolution.
Regardless of consequences, woodcuts were used to heap mockery upon the
hierarchy as well as the rulers who did not sufficiently comply with the
desires of the nobility or the oppressed peasantry. Luther, by his
polemical tracts against the Church, had, from the beginning of his
career, set the example of evading the existing censorship laws. During
the diet of Worms quite a number of publications appeared in favor of
the new doctrines. Aleander complained that his character was subject to
defamation by publications and pictures in the city of the high
assembly. At the time when Luther himself was condemned, and even prior
to his condemnation, there were circulated at Worms and in other places
in the empire, pictorial representations of him with the dove, the
symbol of the Holy Ghost, hovering above his head. Other pictures
represented him with a halo. A booklet on the Passion of Martinus,
patterned after the Gospel narrative of the Passion of Christ, was
published, in which he was glorified as a persecuted hero.

When the report of the edict of outlawry reached Luther at the Castle of
Wartburg, he wrote to Amsdorf:#footnote[#emph[Briefwechsel];, III, p.
151; May 12.] "A cruel edict has gone forth against me, but God will
laugh at them" (Ps. 37:13). Spalatin he informed#footnote[#emph[Ibid.];,
p. 153; same day.] that he was aggrieved at this procedure, not for his
own sake, but because his opponents thereby heaped disaster upon their
heads and the time of their punishment was evidently at hand. He adds in
reference to his opponent, Duke George of Saxony, a man distinguished by
the traits of a noble character: "Would that this swine of Dresden were
found worthy to kill me during a public sermon! If it pleased God, I
should suffer for the sake of His Word. The will of the Lord be done."

In these first letters he also rejoices in the unchained power of the
masses (#emph[moles vulgi imminentis];), who were, he said, preparing
terror for the authors of the edict and all his persecutors; it is
evident, he adds, that the people are unwilling and unable to tolerate
any longer the yoke of the pope and the papists.

Rendered confident by these phenomena, he continues to indulge his
scornful denunciation of the edict: "Swine and asses are able to see how
stubbornly they act …What if my death should prove a disaster to you
all? God is not to be trifled with." Thus he exclaims a few years later,
when, to show his contempt, he incorporates the entire lengthy document
in his work #emph[Zwei kaiserliche uneinige Gebote] (Two Discordant
Imperial Commandments; 1524), and accompanies them with biting
comments.#footnote[#emph[Werke];, Weimar ed., XV, pp. 254 sqq.] In a
frenzy of higher inspiration he advises that "everyone who believes in
the existence of God keep away from the commandments (of the imperial
proclamation)." "If they kill me, there will be such a slaughter as
neither they nor their children will be able to overcome."
