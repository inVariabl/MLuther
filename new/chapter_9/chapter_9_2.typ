== Ghosts and Illusions
<ghosts-and-illusions>
Whilst Luther was engaged in the composition of his last mentioned book,
he announced to Spalatin: "I am suffering from temptation, and out of
temper; so don’t be offended. There is more than one Satan contending
with me. I am alone, and yet at times not alone."#footnote[#emph[Op.
cit.];, Vol. II, p. 82.] He believed that he was visibly pursued by
infernal powers because of his praiseworthy discoveries. His intimate
friend, the physician Matthew Ratzeberger, quotes Luther as saying that,
"Because he was so lonely, he was beset with ghosts and noisy spirits
which gave him much concern, and he drove them all away by prayer; but
did not wish to talk about it."#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol. VI, p.
123; Köstlin-Kawerau, #emph[M. Luther];, Vol. I, p. 440.] Nevertheless
Luther in his later #emph[Table Talks] expressed his firm conviction
that he had encountered the visible Satan. Both Ratzeberger and Luther
make mention of the devil’s assuming the form of a dog.#footnote[Grisar,
#emph[Luther];, II, pp. 83] A big black bulldog resisted him one night
as he was about to go to bed, and departed only after Luther had recited
a verse of the Psalms. According to Luther’s own story, he seized the
dog and threw him out of the window. He states that there was no such
dog at the Wartburg. On another occasion he was disturbed at night by a
sack of hazelnuts, locked in a chest, which by the power of the evil one
were thrown one after another against the rafters of his room, while his
bed was violently jolted. At the same time a rumbling noise was heard on
the staircase, as if barrels were being rolled down. And yet, the
staircase, as Luther convinced himself, was locked below with bolts and
chains.#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol. VI, p. 124. This and the next
pages of my larger work also furnish the evidence for the following
incidents.] Thus, as Mathesius assures us, "he often heard the rumbling
noises of the evil spirit at night in his Patmos \[#emph[i.e.];, at the
Wartburg\]." It was frequently a struggle, he continues, like Christ’s,
when He was tempted in the desert. When he changed his quarters to
accommodate the wife of Hans Berlips, she heard such an ado in the room
that she fancied a thousand devils were in it.” Luther himself reports
that "at Eisenach" (#emph[i.e.];, probably at the Wartburg) he had
contemptuously called to the devil on such an occasion: "If you are
Christ’s master, so be it!" "I have learned by experience," he says
elsewhere, "that ghosts go about affrightening people, preventing them
from sleeping and so making them ill."

But he experienced not only tribulations, but also consolation and
encouragement from the world beyond.

"Ten years ago," he said (1532) to his pupil Schlaginhaufen, "God
strengthened me in my struggles and writings through His angels." The
period thus indicated probably refers to the months he spent at the
Wartburg. Perhaps the vision with which his pupils were acquainted also
happened at this time. While he, engaged in the service of the Word–thus
the story runneth–was praying in his chamber, the image of Christ
bearing the five wounds, appeared to him in shining splendor. However,
as he was in doubt, thinking it might be the evil spirit, he said:
"Begone, thou infamous devil," whereat the image forthwith disappeared.
For some definite reason, Luther disliked to indulge in such narratives,
because the fanatics, his enemies, piqued themselves on their
enlightenment and revelations, instead of abiding by the Biblical texts
as propounded by Luther. He did not look favorably upon communications
from the other world. If, nevertheless, he exploited his own experiences
in terms such as the following, their significance is all the more
enhanced. "Ah, bah, spirits!" he exclaims, "I too have seen spirits!"

He had other similar experiences both before and after his sojourn at
the Wartburg.

His mind was naturally receptive to such experiences. Even as a monk,
when he studied at night in the refectory preparing to become a
professor, he heard the devil rustling about in the woodbin, and again
later on in his room at the monastery. "The devil," he says, "often had
me by the hair of my head, yet was ever forced to let me go." He claims
to have seen "gruesome ghosts and visions" from time to time in the
monastery, and "no one was able to comfort" him. More important is the
following report. In the course of official business with Gregory Casel,
a delegate of the reformed theologians of Strasburg, in 1525, Luther
assured him that, while in the monastery, he "frequently had inward
experience that the body of Christ is indeed in the Sacrament" (a dogma
which the Zwinglians did not believe); that he had seen dreadful
visions, also angels (#emph[se angelos vidisse];), so that he had been
obliged to stop saying Mass.” "What do the Strasburgers mean with their
alleged ghost?" he asks. "Are they alone in possession of it? But
particularly, have they experienced the terrors of death which I have
been through (#emph[mortis horrorem expertus];)?"

Luther’s visionary experiences cannot be doubted. They were gross
imaginings of preternatural annoyances and corroborations,
misinterpretations of internal and external experiences which are well
established, particularly for the period he spent at the Wartburg. He
named the castle his Patmos, evidently because it was there that he,
like the Apostle John when in exile on the isle of Patmos, had
preternatural experiences. His extremely active imagination rendered him
very susceptible to hallucinations and illusions, especially when
accompanied by precordialgia, a physical ailment from which he
frequently suffered, or by severe constipation, to which he was also
subject at times, and of which he complains at the Wartburg, or when his
nerves were overwrought in consequence of excessive literary labors. The
enlightenment which he imagined to have received, naturally revolved
about his divine vocation as herald of the new gospel. Thus Luther, for
all future time, received his spiritual baptism at his Patmos. The most
precious "firstfruits of the spirit" (#emph[primitie spiritus];, as he
calls them), were allotted to him there.#footnote[#emph[Op. cit.];, Vol.
III, p. 116.] He says, apparently in allusion to a mysterious event
relative to his doctrine: "Under threat of the curse of eternal wrath, I
have been found worthy in no manner to doubt these things" (#emph[fui
dignus, cui sub wterne ire maledictione interminaretur, ne ullo modo de
iis dubitarem];).#footnote[The passage is now to be found in Tischreden,
Weimar ed., IV, No. 4852, among the #emph[Table Talks] of the Khumer
collection, July, 1543, and is reproduced as a copy from Luther’s
Psalter. Luther wrote in almost identical terms to his friend Jonas,
when the latter was ill in 1540 and "in the greatest temptation,"
introducing his letter as follows: "#emph[Contra tentationem
indignitatis mostrae sic respondendum est diabolo];" (Weimar ed.,
#emph[l.c.];, note). He wished to indicate to his frightened friend, how
he quieted himself. The possible relation to a single experience of
Luther is made clear by the connection of the longer passage:
"#emph[Martinus Lutterus indignus sum, sed dignus fui creari a creatore
meo, dignus fui redimi a Filio Dei, dignus fui doceri a Filio Dei et
Spiritu sancto, dignus fui, cui ministerium verbi crederetur, dignus
fui, qui pro eo tents paterer, dignus fui, qui in toto malis servarer,
dignus fui, cui praeciperetur ista credere, dignus fui, cui sub
aeternae];," etc. Aurifaber thus reproduced the conclusion: "\[Yet I am
worthy\] that I ought by no means to doubt it, I who have been severely
threatened and enjoined by the wrath of God, His displeasure and
execration." (Weim. ed., #emph[l.c.];) Luther’s idea that God was
leading him into hell, in order to assure him of his salvation, seems to
have arisen from an "experience" made by him at a certain juncture of
his life.] How then, in Luther’s imagination, was it possible that the
devil should not have opposed his election?

Legend has expanded this struggle with the devil. There is no certain
warrant for the report of the apparition which in time has come to be
the most popular of the Wartburg tales. Luther nowhere says that he
hurled the ink-well at the devil, nor do his pupils mention the
incident. The famous spot on the wall is unattested, and its historicity
is not confirmed by the fact that it has constantly been retouched,
whenever the devotion of relic-hunters had gradually scraped it off.
Such spots, all originating from an ink-well which Luther hurled at his
satanic majesty, were formerly to be found also in other places,
#emph[e.g.];, in the rooms which Luther occupied in Wittenberg and at
the Koburg.#footnote[Grisar, #emph[Luther];, Vol. II, p. 96.]
